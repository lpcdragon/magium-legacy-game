            text: "\"Hello?\" Daren says, as he and the rest of us are currently standing in the main hallway of the Ollendor palace, waiting for something to happen. \"Overseer, are you there?... We came here as you asked. We would like to discuss our future plans with you now, if you don't mind!\"\r\n\r\nAside from the echo of Daren's voice, we do not get any answer. There were no guards at the entry of the castle that we could ask for details before we came in, and no red-eyed drones waiting for us either. When we opened the door to the palace, we saw that the inside of the building was empty as well. It wasn't missing the jewelry and ornaments, like the castle from Thilias, but there were no sentries of any kind and there was no sound coming from the other rooms. \r\n\r\nIf the architecture of this building is in any way similar to the Thilias palace, then the door in front of us should normally be leading us to another hallway that is directly connected to the throne room. The Overseer did call us to the palace, but he never specified in which of the rooms we were supposed to meet up with him. Is he waiting for us to enter the throne room before he reveals himself?\r\n\r\n\"You guys don't suppose this is some kind of trap, do you?\" Hadrik asks us."

Maybe there's hidden treasure in this castle!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not allowed to do anything until you get rid of these flames,\" Illuna tells Flower. \"You promised that you'd deal with it, so deal with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm so tired from leading all those rebels in the ethereal plane to their sanctuaries!\" Flower says. \"Couldn't I just take a teeny weeny little break?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get your break once you finish what you're supposed to do,\" Illuna says. \"Now get back to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine...\" Flower says. \"I'll see what I can do.\""

During this time, Flower and Peter have been very busy guiding all of the rebels' souls back to their sanctuaries in the ethereal plane, and once the last of them woke up, the king of the underground called for an urgent meeting, so that all of the underground denizens could democratically choose who would be their proposal for the new king of Ollendor, now that the old king was dead."

If she doesn't learn to transform herself back to normal at will, she could easily burn herself out. This isn't a matter that we can just put on hold until later. It's very serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that, but... isn't there some way you could help her?\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, no,\" Illuna says. \"I do not have much knowledge about ethereals, and Arraka hasn't exactly been of much help either. Right now, Flower is the only one who can figure out what happened to her, and how to undo the transformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, I'm just throwing around ideas here,\" Hadrik says, \"but don't you think you might have a better chance of getting help from Arraka if you would open her locket?\""

Perhaps a little spinning could make her slightly more cooperative. Would anyone care to give it a try?\""

Hey, that's as much in her interest as it is in ours. She already admitted that she is personally invested in this plan of using us to exact her revenge upon the gods. She's not going to give up on it just because of a little spinning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry is correct,\" Illuna says. \"If you are worried that Arraka will suddenly stop training you just because of a little spat, then I can assure you that this is not the case. She may grumble a bit at first, but in the end she will continue to cooperate with you like before. This plan is too important for her to allow it to fail because of such childish reasons.\""

Once that is done, we will look for mages who are willing to transfer their energy to the towers on a daily basis, in exchange for a generous monthly fee, and then we will gradually release the prisoners until there will be none of them left inside the towers.\""

Our role in this story is over, and we're going to have to accept that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Argh!\" Hadrik says. \"It pisses me off that we're letting that smug tin can become the ruler of this place after everything he's said to us back there. But we did all agree that we'd help him defeat the rebel forces, so I admit that I am partly to blame for what has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just because he was acting a bit high and mighty with us doesn't mean that he'll be a bad leader,\" Daren says. \"At the very least, as a machine he should do fewer mistakes than his human predecessors. We should probably wait a few weeks to see what he does, before we pass any judgment on him.\""

It's too risky for you to make any sort of physical effort on this plane of existence, considering how much strain your evolved state is likely putting on your body.

Right, guys?\"\r\n\r\nWe all nod slowly in agreement without saying anything else, as we are still in somewhat of a shock after having seen Illuna's sudden outburst. It is not often that we see Illuna losing her calm and collected demeanor like this, and if I'm not mistaken, the only times I've ever seen her get so upset it has always been because of Arraka. I suppose this shouldn't surprise me, given their past together.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" Illuna says, now in a slightly more reserved tone. \"I just wanted to make sure that we are all on the same page, that's all. Let's pay attention to the podium. I think they might be about to announce the winner.\" \r\n\r\nAs Illuna turns around, the rest of us exchange a few looks, and then we all continue to spectate the election, in silence."

Once we reach our destination, the teleporting engineer that replaced Barry Thundercloud hits a few buttons on his control panel and he sends us to the surface, in the middle of a shopping district.\r\n\r\nFrom the looks of things, it seems that some of the citizens have already noticed that the lockdown was over, because there were a few people entering the shops here and there, even if not that many. As we are still deciding which shop to visit first, we suddenly hear Flower gasping loudly, while she is still being carried by Melindra's air currents.\r\n\r\n\"I think I got it!\" Flower says, in a loud voice. \"Melindra, can you put me down for a second?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\" Melindra says. \"Oh yeah, sure.\""

As she is apparently gathering every ounce of focus that she has in order to concentrate on her current task, her eyes begin to gradually turn back to their normal green color, while the invisible burning flames in her aura also seem to be slowly getting extinguished.\r\n\r\nA few seconds later, Flower returns completely back to normal, with a big smile on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Hah!\" she says, happily. \"I did it! I can't believe I managed to do it! I have it all under control, now! Look!\"\r\n\r\nShe then squeezes her fists again, and her eyes begin to turn back to their glowy red color from earlier. Right in the middle of her transformation, her eyes turn blue all of a sudden and Flower smacks herself in the head very hard, which causes her eyes to turn back to normal immediately.\r\n\r\n\"One minute!\" Illuna says. \"All I ask is for one minute without you doing something stupid!

I'm sure that I must only be having some small trouble adjusting my perspective after all those times when the ether forced my consciousness to go back and forth between the ethereal and earthen planes. If I give it one more day, this sensation will probably go away by itself. It has to!\r\n\r\n\"No, it's nothing!\" I say. \"I was just testing some flight maneuvers and I messed up a little. All good!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't try anything too dangerous,\" Melindra says. \"There are some really oddly-shaped rooftops below. You wouldn't want to crash into any of them, trust me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I'll try to be more careful!\" I say, and then I start to follow Melindra through the sky again, along with the others.\r\n\r\nWe continue our journey for a while longer, and during this time, the sensation of my consciousness switching between planes does not happen to me anymore.\r\n\r\nIt's fine. I have this under control. A few seconds here and there of going back to the ethereal plane is not that big of a deal. I'll only start worrying if things get worse."

        text: "Before I get the time to think about this any longer, Melindra tells us that we've arrived at our destination, and she signals us to land in front of a very old-looking building. Unlike all the other buildings with crazy designs made by Billy Bob, this particular house looks refreshingly simple, just like any other house that you'd expect to see inside a city.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good!\" Melindra says, once we're all on the ground. \"The old house is still here. I was a little worried that they might have demolished it by now. Okay, let's go inside. I'll show you how to open the passage to the ruins below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruins?...\" Flower asks, confused, as we are now entering the building. \"I thought you said that the puzzle piece was supposed to be inside the house!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Melindra says. \"What I told you was that you needed to go inside the abandoned building in order to get to the puzzle piece. I never said that it was hidden in the building itself. Anyway, it's just some lousy ruins. I already know which levers we need to pull, so it will be over in a few minutes. Don't worry about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if you remember the levers wrong?\" Kate asks her.\r\n\r\n\"I am not remembering them wrong,\" Melindra says, while she presses on a few stones from the ground in quick succession. \"I've already done this a few times before, so I know exactly what I'm doing.\"\r\n\r\nJust as she is done talking, the middle of the floor opens itself up, revealing a hidden staircase to us."

Come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any blue crystals down there, or do we need some light?\" Flower asks Melindra, as we begin to descend the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"No, there are no crystals, as far as I recall,\" Melindra says, \"but I think there are some torches that we can light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Flower says, as she conjures three small balls of flame that are floating next to us, so that we can see where we're going.\r\n\r\nOnce we reach the ruins below, Flower uses her balls of fire to light all of the torches on the walls, and then she makes her magic flames disappear.\r\n\r\n\"Wow, that's a lot of levers...\" Flower says, when she gets a good look at the corridor walls.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, pay attention!\" Melindra says. \"There's a very specific order in which these levers need to be pulled, with some waiting times in-between. I will handle all of it, but when I get to the final lever, whoever wants a puzzle piece will need to stand over there, by the wall, because the puzzle piece dispenser will only be available for a short time. Got it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it!\" Flower says.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" says Melindra. \"Here I go, then.\""

I did feel sort of like that when the Overseer was the one who sent my consciousness to the ethereal plane by force, but not anymore.

No matter what happens in the future, we will always be able to look back on this day and remember it with a smile on our faces. Of that, I am certain.\r\n\r\n\"Have you thought about what you're going to do after we leave?\" I ask Leila. \"Will you be staying with the rebels in the underground, or will you move somewhere else?\""

I've already spoken to my father yesterday about our alliance with the Overseer, and he agreed that it would be best if we both moved somewhere on the surface, after the end of the conflict. We have a meeting spot where we will be seeing each other later in the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure they'll let him leave the caverns?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"They'll let him,\" Leila writes. \"I have no doubts about that. Even if they suspect him to be a traitor, they simply owe him too much to not at least allow him to leave their base safely. But I don't think they should have any reasons to suspect him. As far as they know, we've all been captured by the Overseer together with the rebel fighters, so it would be perfectly normal that my father would want to go to the surface to look for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose that's true,\" I say."
