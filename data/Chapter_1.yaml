        text: "They say there is a very fine line between bravery and stupidity. As I stand here, in the middle of this forest, gazing at all of the explosions far in the distance, I realize I may well have crossed that line, to a point of no return.\r\n\r\nMy name is Barry. I am twenty-eight years old, and  I could quite accurately be described as your everyday ordinary guy. I have no talents, no particular skills and no academic background. The only thing that defines me is my lifelong obsession to become a mage. It is what I've wished for ever since I was five years old. It has been my driving passion throughout my life, as I've constantly amassed knowledge about mages and travelled the world in the hopes of finding a way to make my dream come true.\r\n\r\nAfter endless years of searching through dusty tomes and weathered parchments I have finally found a way to do it.\r\n\r\nThe catch? I need to first win a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world. Sounds crazy? That's probably because it is. But it is far too late to go back now. The only way that's left for me is forward.\r\n\r\nAs I stand here, knowing that it's no longer possible to return to my normal life, I can't help but feel quite..."

            text: "...excited about this whole thing.  Maybe I really am completely out of my mind. I would have expected to feel at least a little bit scared about all of this. But instead of that, I get this constant tingling sensation that won't go away. The feeling that I am closer to my dream than ever before in my life.  All of the terrible dangers that await me seem distant to me, and all I can  really think about now is that at the end of the tournament, when I win this, I will finally become a mage.\r\n\r\nThere's an explosion maybe a few hundred feet from my location. The fights have already begun. And one of them is much closer to me than I would have hoped. There's no way I can get in a fight with any of the mages at this point. I need to avoid combat for as long as possible if I am to survive until the end.\r\n\r\nI head in the opposite direction from where I've heard the explosion. As I am heading towards the end of the forest, I start hearing voices. There are two mages talking in a clearing a few feet away from me. I hide behind a tree and take a quick glance towards the clearing. \r\n\r\nIt seems the two mages have just finished fighting. One of them has the appearance of an ordinary thug. He is wearing a simple stained white shirt, leather pants and a belt full of throwing knives. His untrimmed black beard hides a wicked smile. Just by seeing the confidence in his eyes, I can clearly tell he is the victor of the skirmish. The other mage is wearing heavy armor, but his shield lies on the ground besides him and he is barely holding his sword anymore."

We aren't allowed to hurt the humans that live on this continent, so their spell warns us when one of them is near. If what they said can be believed, their spell is supposed to stop us even before we try hurting any of the locals. If it's accidental then it simply stops us before doing it. If it's intentional, it eliminates us from the tournament and sends us back. \r\n\r\nTheir spell is also supposed to act as a means of communication with the organizers. They said they'll transmit the objectives to each of us individually. It's funny. All of those careful preparations on their side, and they never even bothered to check if I was a mage or not. Hell, what am I saying? They probably didn't even care.\r\n\r\n\"So you must be a participant, then,\" Daren continues. \"What reason would you have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?\"\r\n\r\nI am after the same thing as every other participant in this tournament, Daren, but I'm not sure how wise it would be to tell you of this."

The Magium.\r\n\r\nNobody knows exactly what it looks like, or what it's made of, but everyone knows the fact that it is the source of all magic in the world, and that it can only be found on the continent of Varathia. All mages seek it. They crave it. They are certain that if they have access to it, they can increase their powers a hundredfold and become living legends. And although it is a common misconception that the Magium is only useful for learned mages, my studies have led me to believe that the Magium is so extraordinary that it can even turn a normal human into a mage.\r\n\r\nI've searched very long for a way to get into Varathia, but the only way one can travel to their continent is by receiving a direct invitation. Very few of those are sent yearly, and the people being teleported there are being held under direct supervision for the duration of their stay, and return with no information regarding the coordinates of the place.\r\n\r\nBut when all hope seemed lost, the announcement came. A worldwide announcement by the kings of Varathia that they were organizing a tournament where every single mage in the world was invited. And the winner would be granted access to the Magium.   \r\n\r\nI knew then that there would never be another chance like this. \r\n\r\n\"Why did you join this tournament, Barry?\" Daren asks me again."

It's been my dream ever since I was little to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Barry. You're going to have to make up a better lie than that if you want me to believe you!\"\r\n\r\nHe stops and looks me straight in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"By the gods... You are being serious! Barry, I commend your bravery and determination but... You do realize you can't win this entire tournament just by bluffing, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I know that! That's not the only ace I have up my sleeve. But what about you? They say you are one of the strongest mages in the world. So how does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that...\"\r\n\r\nHe is sounding embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly...\"\r\n\r\n\"The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?\""

I think there's also another way.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah! Remember the rules? They said they'd eliminate us from the tournament and teleport us right back if they detected any intent to harm the locals. You could use that, Barry! You just need to find any of the humans living on this continent, try to punch them in the face, and you'll be set free!\"\r\n\r\n\"I..uh... I never thought of it this way.\""
