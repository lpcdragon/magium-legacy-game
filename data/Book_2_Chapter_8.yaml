        text: "\"There you are!\" Melindra says, once we all get within hearing range of her. \"Just in time. Tell me, are you all ready to begin our adventure?\"\r\n\r\n\"If by adventure, you mean waiting in line for an hour, then yes,\" Daren says, as he points towards the city's northern gate.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be at least a few dozen groups of people currently lined up on the main road leading to the northern gate. Some of them are just travellers, like us, but most of them appear to be merchants, with carts full of wares that need to be inspected one by one by the guards at the city's exit, before they are allowed to pass through the gate. Judging by how long it's taking the guards to inspect each cart, I'd say that Daren's estimation might actually be a bit optimistic. We're probably going to be stuck here for a lot longer than one hour.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" Melindra says, as she takes a glance towards the very long line of carts in front of her. \"I forgot that the northern gate is primarily used by merchants in this city. It would have been so much nicer if they actually made more than one gate on their northern wall, to solve their traffic problems.\""

        text: "\"More gates means more vulnerable areas that need to be protected,\" Daren says. \"It would not be a good idea in times such as these, when monster attacks are rampant. Let's just line up like all the others. The sun is barely up, so we'll have plenty of time to travel even if we waste another hour in this city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, I have a better idea,\" Melindra says. \"We'll be taking a shortcut!\"\r\n\r\n\"A shortcut?\" Hadrik asks, confused. \"You mean, like an underground tunnel, or...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no...\" Melindra says, with a smile. \"I wasn't talking about a tunnel.\"\r\n\r\nShe then snaps her fingers, and we all begin to slowly get raised into the air, higher and higher, as I feel several currents of air moving around me, in a similar fashion to how they used to move when I was using air magic to fly, during my battle with the skeleton stillwaters."

Are you out of your mind? This is against the law! Those guards stationed on the wall are going to start shooting at us the moment we go over them!\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what?\" Melindra says. \"You're a white mage and an enchanter, aren't you? You can just use that shield of yours to create a barrier around us, and we'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have any barrier spells that deflect regular arrows!\" Daren shouts.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, seriously?\" Melindra says, while raising an eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"And besides, that's not the point!\" Daren says. \"We don't want to make this whole city into our enemy just because we were too lazy to wait in line!\""

I hope at least someone in this group can defend against arrows, because lifting so many people at once using only air magic requires a great deal of concentration, and I don't want to risk dropping any of you while trying to deflect incoming projectiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Attention, to all the mages that are now flying over our wall,\" we hear a guard shouting through a magical voice magnifier, from the top of the city's wall. \"You are to descend at once! I repeat. You are to descend at once! If you ignore this warning, we will treat you as an enemy of the kingdom, and we will open fire! I will not repeat this again!\""

But hey, if you think you can stop me yourself, then I invite you to try. I can't wait to see what you're planning to do against a stillwater of my caliber-- AHAHAHA-- Stop it! Stop it or I'll-- Ahahaha!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Melindra was busy bragging, I decided I'd had enough, so I put both my hands to the sides of her waist, and began to tickle her from behind. As the girl laughs, I can feel the air currents around me become more unstable, and I start to wobble uncontrollably, in the air, along with everybody else.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it!\" Melindra says, while struggling to control her laughter. \"I can't-- ahaha-- I can't move away from you while I'm concentrating on levitating everyone!

By the time we all make it to the ground, right outside the city walls, the captain of the guards is already waiting for us impatiently, with a few of the other guards accompanying him, as his escorts. The captain is a dwarf, of around the same size as Hadrik, wearing heavy armor, with a long brown beard covering the bottom half of his face, and a steel helmet covering much of the rest, aside from his eyes and his nose. \r\n\r\nAs soon as we reach his position, Daren and I quickly begin to explain to him what happened, while repeatedly reassuring him that we were not looking to start a fight, when we flew over their walls.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh...\" the captain of the guards says with his eyes closed, as he rubs his forehead, while shaking his head in disapproval. \"You know, if you really needed to leave the city in a hurry, you could have just asked one of the guards by the gate. We were all there when you people fought the dragon yesterday, together with king Golmyck, so it wouldn't have been a problem to do you a small favor in return for your service. Listen, I'm going to try my best to keep this incident off the records, but please, for the love of all the gods, don't do this kind of crap anymore. We guards are busy enough as it is. We don't have time to deal with your shenanigans.\""

Just make sure to deal with their arrows until we're out of their range. I mean... not you! Someone else. Someone else take care of the arrows!\"\r\n\r\nAs Melindra is talking, the captain of the guards gives the order to attack, and now there are dozens of arrows heading in our direction. As soon as she sees the arrows, Kate immediately conjures several shields made of ice, which begin to move in the air all around us, defending us from the enemy's projectiles. \r\n\r\n\"You know, it would be much easier if you just killed the archers...\" Melindra tells Kate.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to kill the city guards for doing their job,\" Kate says, in a cold voice. \"We are the ones in the wrong here, not them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright, alright...\" Melindra says. \"I'll try to increase our speed, so we'll get out of their range faster.\"\r\n\r\nAfter about twenty more seconds, the arrows that are being shot towards us from the wall can no longer reach us, and eventually, the archers stop firing at us. Fortunately, they don't seem to be very keen on pursuing us outside the city limits, so with a little luck, this will be the last we've seen of them."

Maybe he'll ask you to pay a fine or something, but I'm sure he wouldn't send you to jail for something so minor. Alright, this is as good a place as any. I'm bringing us back to the ground!\"\r\n\r\nMelindra then makes a waving motion with her hands, and we all start to descend towards the grassy plain below us.

There's no need for us to take such precautions, though. Most of you are powerful mages, right? Well, nowhere near as powerful as I am, but still...\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you stop with the condescending remarks?\" I tell her. \"It's clear that your level of power cannot even compare to that of Eiden.

Hell, I practically finished them all off by myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop bragging, you idiot!\" Arraka says. \"If it weren't for my advice, and your stupidly overpowered lessathi relic, those 'regular' stillwaters would have stomped you all into the ground!\""

Isn't that right, Melindra?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if I am?\" Melindra says.\r\n\r\n\"That's like... the single weakest type of elementalist in existence,\" I say. \"Even if you take into account all the artificial mages with their non-traditional elements invented by the lessathi. Can you even cast anything other than wind spells?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can!\" Melindra says, visibly upset.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\" I say. \"Well, why don't you teleport us all to the city of Ollendor right now, then?

She then stops very high up in the sky, and she appears to be raising her arms in the air, as she is channeling her spell. Not long afterwards, we feel a very powerful wind coming towards us, as we watch the air currents below Melindra spinning faster and faster, until they turn into a full-blown tornado. \r\n\r\nDozens of trees are now getting pulled from their roots and being lifted into the air by the giant twister in the distance, and even large rocks underneath the soil are starting to break off from the ground.

        text: "\"Thank you!\" Melindra says. \"So, anyway, after several conversations with Eiden, I found out that the food they were serving him was of extremely poor quality. Since I was also in charge of serving dishes, and I had access to the kitchen, I offered to sneak some better food into his cell, every once in a while, in exchange for certain rocks from the pile in his corner. At first, he thought that I wasn't being serious, and he accepted the trade, somewhat in jest. But when he actually saw me bring him the food, while holding out my hand, waiting for my hard earned prize, he looked rather shocked. I had to point several times towards the rock that I wanted before he actually gave it to me. He also seemed to be amused every time I referred to our bargains as even trades, but I'm not sure exactly why. He never told me the reason.\"\r\n\r\nAs Melindra talks, I suddenly remember my first conversation with Eiden, when I also offered him my own version of an 'even trade'. After hearing this story, I think I'm starting to understand a bit better why he burst out laughing like that when I made my proposition to him.\r\n\r\n\"You collect rocks?\" Flower says, all of a sudden. \"Do you still have them with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course!\" Melindra says. \"I always carry them with me. My collection has gotten a lot larger in the past six hundred years, but I still have those original rocks that I started my collection with here in my backpack. Do you want to see them?\""

As I was suspecting, none of the rocks seem to have any real marketable value, and they would look completely worthless to anyone else, but that still doesn't seem to stop Flower from marveling at every one of the rocks, while Melindra proudly explains to her the features that made her consider the stones to be worthy of her collection, making sure to also give her a brief summary of where she found each of them.\r\n\r\nWhile Melindra and Flower are having their discussion, Daren gives the rest of us a signal, and we all slow down a bit to have a talk, outside of Melindra's hearing range, while still following her.\r\n\r\n\"So, what do you all think about Melindra so far?\" Daren whispers, while making sure that Melindra isn't paying attention to us. \"Do you think that she might be working with Eiden?\""

The orc manages to smash the icy spike with his enchanted mace, but he loses his momentum, and doesn't get to attack Leila anymore, who quickly slides out of his reach.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take the ogres,\" Hadrik says, as he rushes towards the two ogres that were trying to jump us from behind.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Flower engulfs one of the orcs in a pillar of fire, but he walks out of it completely unscathed, thanks to his anti-magic armor, and he starts running towards her, with his broadsword at the ready.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it!\" Flower says, as she jumps out of the orc's way and rolls on the ground.\r\n\r\nOnce I get a clear shot of the orc that attacked Flower, I aim my crossbow for the narrow slit in his helm, and I pull the trigger."

Daren seems to have his hands full, fighting the orc captain with the flaming axes. The orc appears to have completely thrown away his defense, and he is focusing on delivering relentless attacks, one after the other, in order to not give Daren the chance to retaliate. Hadrik is still fighting the ogres behind us, and from what I can see, they are giving him just as much trouble as the ogre captain from the fort, so he'll probably still be busy with them for a while.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Leila is fighting three orcs at once, in an attempt to keep them away from our spell casters, while Kate, Flower and Illuna are all struggling to find ways to penetrate the orcs' anti-magic armor.\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe you people!\" Arraka shouts, from her amulet, as Flower tries to aim a fireball in a way that would not hit Leila, along with the orcs. \"You were fighting the dragon head-on yesterday, but now you can't deal with a few of his lowly mooks? Are a bunch of anti-magic armors really all it takes to throw you into disarray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I'll have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed, here,\" Melindra says, as she calmly looks around her, at all the people who are fighting for their lives. \"If this is how these people handle a well-organized team of reasonably-skilled combatants, I shudder to think how they will handle Ollendor's numerous teams of mercenaries.\""

As soon as he reaches her, the orc swings his mace hard towards her, in an attempt to bash her head in, but the girl evades his strike by floating a few inches above the ground, while pushing herself away from him with a small burst of air from the palms of her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Quit it!\" Melindra shouts at the orc. \"Fight them, not me! What are you, stupid?\"\r\n\r\nThe orc ignores her completely, and he tries to hit her again, this time with his shield.\r\n\r\n\"I said, cut it out!\" Melindra shouts at him, as she makes another jump backwards.\r\n\r\nShe then props herself into the ground with her feet, assuming a rather peculiar stance, as she bends her knees and keeps her elbows close to her body, while she faces her palms towards her attacker.\r\n\r\nA very powerful burst of air then comes out of her hands, as the orc gets blown away, and thrown directly towards Kate, who was just about to launch an ice cone at one of Leila's opponents. Seeing the orc flying in her direction, Kate is forced to cancel her spell and to jump out of the way, in order to avoid getting knocked off her feet."

        text: "Before Arraka gets to answer, we hear the sound of a very loud horn, coming from the area where all of our friends were fighting, and only a few seconds afterwards, the two dots representing the goblins disappear from Arraka's map, along with the auras of all the orcs and the ogres from the battlefield.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Illuna says, \"at least now we know what the goblins were there for. One of them was maintaining the suggestion spell, while the other one laid in wait, in a secluded place where he could not be disturbed, in case he needed to concentrate on casting the teleportation spell, after receiving the signal to retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get back to the others,\" I say. \"Hopefully, everyone is alright.\"\r\n\r\nAs we get back to the area where all the fighting took place, we soon find out that not everyone had managed to walk out of the conflict completely unscathed. Leila is now lying on the ground, with her left ankle red and swollen, as Daren is kneeling beside her, while holding his hands slightly above her wound, with a bright white light coming out of them.\r\n\r\n\"You just need to bear with this for a little longer,\" Daren says, as he sees Leila grimacing from the pain, without making any sounds. \"The healing spell is almost done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gods, what happened here?\" Flower says."

        text: "\"Leila managed to kill two of the orcs she was fighting by herself,\" Daren says, \"but the third one crushed her leg with his mace before she got the time to retreat. At least this gave Kate the opening she needed to aim one of her ice cones through the open slit in his helm, in order to finish him off, but the wound that Leila took was no joke. It looks much better now than it did before. Anyway, after the three orcs got killed, their captain jumped away from me and he blew in his horn, to sound the retreat. What happened to the goblins? Did they get away along with the other monsters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"We didn't manage to reach them in time because they had a suggestion spell that was keeping us away from them. They got the signal to retreat before we could find a way to get around the spell's effects.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where did they go?\" Hadrik says. \"Are they planning to ambush us again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nah,\" Arraka says. \"They're gone. If I can't sense them, then they've probably retreated back to their main headquarters. Wherever that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, it's healed,\" Daren says, as Leila's ankle goes back to its normal color and size. \"But not completely. You shouldn't try any more acrobatic stunts for at least a day, until you fully recover. You should be able to walk without much trouble, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you...\" Leila writes, as she gets up from the ground."

I then use my weapon to cut the tree in a single movement, and just as the tree begins to fall to the ground, I sheathe my blade and I grab the tree with both my hands, in order to use it as my new weapon.\r\n\r\nAs I take a look towards the three orcs that were fighting Leila, all of the combatants from the battleground seem to have briefly stopped fighting, to look towards me, with shocked expressions on their faces. I take advantage of their momentary bewilderment to make a dash towards the three orcs with the maces, and I immediately crush one of them underneath the weight of the tree's trunk.\r\n\r\n\"Leila, step away from the orcs,\" I say."

These mindless brutes might be okay with losing their peripheral vision over some extra defense, but when you're on a battlefield with enemies coming from every side, limiting your vision is the last thing any sane person would want to do! Then there's also the fact that this scar I have on my forehead makes me easily recognizable to most people nowadays, and when people recognize me, they usually tend to get intimidated, and not engage me in battle, which helps avoid some unnecessary bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get that scar, anyway?\" Hadrik says. \"I've never asked. And why is it shaped like an 'x'? Is there like a monster with an 'x' shaped tail that I don't know about, or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Daren says. \"The 'x' is actually formed from two separate scars that I got during the same battle.\""

Well, he wasn't a sage back when he was training me, but he became one afterwards, and he lost the title in the next year. He was an extremely harsh teacher, especially when it came to martial arts, and he was the type that always tried to make you learn lessons from your own experience, rather than just giving you the answer himself. As his final lesson, he told me to fight him with all my strength, by using everything he's ever taught me. This is when I got my two scars. The first time he wounded me, I did not understand his lesson, so he decided to cut me a second time, in the exact same spot, from the opposite side, in order to properly get his point across. Only then, did I realize that the whole purpose of that battle was to show me a huge weakness in my fighting style that I'd ignored for years, without giving it much thought. The third time when he attacked me in the same spot, I was ready for him, and I quickly disarmed him, which concluded my last lesson. Now, every time I see my reflection in the water, it reminds me to always remain vigilant, and to always look out for even the tiniest of weaknesses, because in a real battle, they can mean the difference between life and death.\""

From what I understood, he left because of the very poor way in which the goblins were being treated by the dragon, and by the other monster races. They may be the most resourceful of the monster races, but physically, they are by far the weakest, and there aren't many mages born in their race either. As such, the goblins were always being forced to perform menial tasks, they were ridiculed by the other monster races, and they were almost always on the verge of starvation. When Fyron left Tyrath's army, and took his goblins with him, the dragon never bothered to stop them, because they were mostly irrelevant to him, and so, the goblins formed a new faction, calling themselves the 'free goblins'. Only a fraction of the goblins actually followed Fyron, though. Most of them preferred to stay behind, because at least the dragon would ensure their protection against animals and humans, and he would give them enough food to scrape by. Even some of the goblins that left with Fyron decided later to return to the dragon, due to the even poorer conditions that they were getting in Fyron's camp.  However, those who decided to stay, eventually managed to make a better life for themselves than they used to have, after a few long years of hard work and effort, and in time, they managed to get other goblins, and even other types of monsters to willingly join their camp.\""

They are not as strong as the ogres, but they're not dumb like them, either, and they are generally more powerful than most humans. The orcs are the main force of the dragon's army, but he also has other monsters of the humanoid variety like ogres, trolls and goblins, alongside various creatures such as wyverns and hydras. While it would be pretty unlikely to meet an orc in Varathia that does not serve Tyrath, there are plenty of ogres that have nothing to do with the dragon, like the ones we fought in the fort, and the trolls are mostly a race of mercenaries, so their allegiance to the dragon is fickle. As far as the goblins go, I'd wager that most of the goblins in Varathia still follow Tyrath, although Fyron has also been getting some new recruits in his camp, lately.\""

That's why we're having this discussion, in order to learn from our mistakes, and to improve our tactics for later battles. For example, maybe the next time you want to act as a decoy, you could try to keep your distance from your enemies, instead of actually engaging them in battle, so that you wouldn't put yourself into any immediate danger, which would allow our casters to also pay attention to the rest of the battlefield, without feeling obligated to jump to your aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, I'll try...\" Leila writes."

        text: "\"Also,\" Daren says, \"the next time Hadrik says he'll 'handle the ogres', it doesn't mean that you need to let him handle them all by himself. He may be strong enough to not get himself killed, but if either one of you helped him kill those ogres, he could have made mincemeat out of the orcs, without breaking a sweat. And when I say either one of you, I'm talking especially about you, Kate. A few well-placed ice cones should have been enough to finish off those ogres, given how busy they were with fighting Hadrik. I know that Leila is your friend, but you can't just completely ignore your surroundings every time she is in danger. If we're going to fight as a team from now on, you're going to need to put a little more faith in her fighting capabilities.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand...\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"Hmm?...\" Melindra says, as she turns around, suddenly appearing to gain an interest in our conversation. \"That is some very good advice coming from someone who hasn't been paying attention to his surroundings. Maybe I've been underestimating you a little bit...\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's good advice,\" Daren says. \"I haven't spent the last twenty years fighting monsters for nothing. Also, didn't you say earlier that we wouldn't hear another word from you? Why are you talking to us all of a sudden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmph!\" Melindra says, as she turns around. \"I wasn't talking to you. I was just thinking out loud. There's no reason for me to talk to any of you people.\""

Just this once. Come here, and we'll pick up from where we left off.\"\r\n\r\nAs Flower rushes again to Melindra's side, we all continue our journey through the forest, and for the next few hours, we do not get any more interruptions. For the duration of our journey, Melindra has not spoken again to anyone other than Flower, and the rest of us mostly ignored her as well. While we walked, we sort of split ourselves into little groups, with Kate and Leila in the back, Hadrik, Daren and I in the middle, and Flower and Melindra in the front. It seemed that Kate and Leila had a lot of catching up to do, so we decided to not bother them, and to let them have a little privacy. \r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the group, once Melindra had finished showing Flower the rocks, she began to ask her a lot of technical details about how her fusion with Illuna actually works. Some of the questions were more personal than others, but it didn't seem like Flower was being bothered by them in any way, and she answered them all without hesitation, while Melindra was eying her with a look of sincere and eager curiosity."

It would have been nice if the water that Illuna conjures were actually drinkable, because then we wouldn't have to worry about finding sources of fresh water, but from what she told me, the water that she creates with her spells disappears by itself after a while, so we might as well be drinking empty air.\r\n\r\nAfter I finished eating, I sat down on a rock, and I pulled out my notebook, to see if I could find any more of Eiden's loopholes while we were resting. While I was calmly flipping the pages of my notebook, I could see with the tail of my eye how Melindra was slowly closing in on me, although she seemed to have conflicting feelings about whether she wanted to talk to me or not, and she went back and forth a few times, before she finally decided to stop in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"So, uhm... Barry... was it?\" Melindra says, with an obviously forced smile, while attempting to appear cute and approachable. \"How are you this fine day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that you've finally bothered to learn my name,\" I say, as I casually flip a page from my notebook, without raising my eyes to look at her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your name is easier to remember than the others,\" Melindra says."

            text: "\"What makes you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, marrying a non-lessathi is strictly prohibited in today's lessathi society,\" Melindra says. \"So it stands to reason that any such relationships will remain hidden from the eyes of the other lessathi. This is the reason why you don't really see any more half-lessathi nowadays. However, if a lessathi woman were to become pregnant with the child of a non-lessathi, such a relationship would become much more difficult to hide. I'm thinking that the reason why your parents left this continent was because they considered it would have been too difficult to keep hiding after your mother became pregnant with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, but why would they be related to the top brass?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Because the only people that have access to teleporting devices on this continent are the kings and the lessathi,\" Melindra says. \"And those teleporters are the only way to leave the continent. Since only the highest ranked lessathi have access to the lessathi teleporters, it means that your mother needed to ask help from one of them, if she wanted to leave, and they would need to do it secretly. Maybe you're even related to the leader of the lessathi! I'm guessing you were born around thirty years or so ago, so the leader back then would have been... Heksol. Yeah, that was the name. I think he might have died since then, though. Or was he killed? I'm not sure. I don't really follow lessathi politics that much anymore.\" \r\n\r\n\"Can you two stop talking and focus for a second, here?\" Daren says. \"I can sense a group of mages approaching us.

We spent the rest of the day travelling, without getting into any more fights, although we did run into several groups of mages, who seemed to be very busy gathering pinecones from trees, and stuffing them into their backpacks.\r\n\r\nWhen we decided that it was finally time to make camp, we started placing our tents not too far away from the river that we'd been following since noon. Melindra didn't really seem to want to spend time with our group any longer than she needed to, so as soon as she was done leading us, she went to the river bank, to see if she could find some more rocks to add to her collection.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were done setting up the tents, I immediately pulled out my notebook, because there were a few things that I wanted to check before going to sleep. While I flip through the pages, I suddenly notice an old page where I wrote some notes about the stat device, and one particular phrase catches my attention. According to my old data, the stat booster was supposed to gather more energy from the air, if powerful spells were cast around it, but I've never actually seen this happen since I came to Varathia. Realizing that I may need more info on the subject, I decide to go ask some questions to the only other person in the camp that has more knowledge of stat devices than me."

You see, there was a time when I got to temporarily activate my hidden magical stats, but I only got the option to do it because there was a great amount of magical energy in the air around me at that time. The fact that the makers of the stat device included an option to quickly burn through the available energy makes me think that the energy would have been wasted otherwise, because the device wouldn't have been able to convert it all into stat points fast enough. Do you understand what I'm getting at?\""

        paragraph: 43
        text: "\"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"The energy residue from spells does not stay in the air very long after they've been cast. So, if the stat device cannot convert the energy fast enough, and if it does not have enough capacity to store it for later use, this would mean that in reality, most of the energy that the device is getting is not from spells, but from mage auras.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I was thinking,\" I say. \"But since the device can only extract a very low amount of energy from each person's aura at a time, this means that what really matters is not how powerful the people are, but how many mages there are within the stat booster's radius, which, if I'm not mistaken, should be around thirty miles, give or take. There would likely need to be hundreds of mages within the device's range, for the conversion to stat points to have any noticeable effect. That would sort of explain why the number of points I've been receiving have slowed down, lately, because a lot of mages have died since the beginning of this tournament, but it still wouldn't explain why we've been receiving fewer points while we were in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's because there were other people with stat devices gathered in Thilias,\" Kate says. \"Surely, you couldn't have been the only person to come up with the idea of bringing one with you to this place. And if you didn't know that stat devices would be mostly useless to people without lessathi blood running through their veins, then there were likely others like you, who didn't know that either.\""

Also, one of those lessathi came to threaten me while I was still in my cell, and he wasn't carrying a stat device back then either.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lessathi threatened you?\" Kate asks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Leila writes. \"He was trying to convince me to hand over my stat booster to him, but I refused to do it. He later ordered the arena owner to confiscate it from me, but the owner decided to not listen to him, because he wanted me to keep my stat device, in order to make the fight more interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just remembered that there was something else that I wanted to ask about the stat device,\" I say. \"Leila, you told me that you had level three in both strength and speed, but when you were fighting in the arena, you didn't seem to be much stronger or faster than that troll with the high regeneration. Is your device defective by any chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Leila says. \"My father once told me that the physical stats from the device enhance the physical abilities that you already have, and that the more fit you are, physically, the more effect those stats will have on you.

Nobody outside the tent should be able to hear us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" I ask her, as I slide myself to the opposite end of the tent, in the little space that is available to me. \"How did you even get here?

I feel as if I could run up and down a mountain, and then still have enough energy left to do a thousand push-ups. This spell is amazing! But it's very likely putting quite a strain on my body, so it probably wouldn't be wise to use it for too long. Well, a few hours won't kill me. Let's see how well this works."

I'll open this tent to see if the coast is clear, and if I give you the signal, you'll rush straight out, do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mmm...\" Melindra says, as she raises her head from the ground, with her eyes still half-closed. \"Mmhmm...\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, good,\" I say. \"I'm going to open the tent now. Get ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, hold on!\" Melindra shouts all of a sudden, as she sees me pull on the tent's zipper. \"The silencing spell hasn't been canceled, yet!\"\r\n\r\nAs I finish opening the tent, I immediately regret my decision, because every single one of my teammates are currently standing several dozen feet away from me, and they're all now staring straight at me and Melindra.\r\n\r\n\"Oh... right...\" I say."

But know that you're going to regret this...\"\r\n\r\nShe then pulls on the tent's zipper, and she prepares to exit the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" I say. \"You didn't cast the invisibility spell on yourself!\"\r\n\r\nMelindra ignores me completely, and she exits the tent, closing the zipper behind her."

          Huh. Well, that didn't go so well. Maybe with a little luck Kate
          didn't see her walk out of my tent. Actually, what am I even worrying
          about? Even if she did see her, I should easily be able to explain
          what happened. And it's not like I'm worried about Melindra's threat,
          or anything. She's still under the oath's effect, so there's nothing
          she can do to me. I mean... it's not like she can actually do anything
          to inconvenience me if she can't even use her powers to hurt me.
          Right?...
