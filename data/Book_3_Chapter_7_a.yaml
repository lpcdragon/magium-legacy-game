        text: "The whole world is spinning, and I'm having one hell of a headache. This has got to be the worst hangover I've ever had in my life. What did I even drink yesterday to bring me in this state?\r\n\r\nI can't remember. And if I so much as try to focus on remembering anything that happened before I went to sleep, it starts feeling like a hundred small daggers are moving through my brain. I need to go back to sleep. I'm sure everything will be better once I get more rest.\r\n\r\nThat's right. I need to sleep. Just gonna keep my eyes closed and put my head on the pillow. Do I even have a pillow? Where was it that I fell asleep again? It doesn't matter. All I have to do is go to bed, and I'll figure everything out afterwards."

Now this force is shaking me violently. It wants me to wake up, but I won't lose to it. My eyes are staying closed.\r\n\r\nThe force is still shaking me. It just doesn't know when to give up. Can't it see that I'm trying to sleep, here? Talk about being rude. Maybe I should give this mysterious force a piece of my mind. If I tell it off, it might go away and leave me alone. I just need to choose the right words, to make sure that it will stop bothering me for good."

The force is now gently placing my upper body back on the ground, so I can go to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt worked! My words convinced the force to leave me alone! At long last, it's time for some well-deserved rest.\r\n\r\nI fall asleep almost instantly, but after what couldn't have been more than three minutes, the force pulls me up again and it begins to lightly tap the right side of my face. Seeing that this doesn't wake me up, the force decides to pull my eyes open by itself, until I finally decide to open them of my own free will.\r\n\r\n\"Just a few more minutes,\" I start to say. \"Just a few more minutes and I'll be--\"\r\n\r\nWhen I open my eyes completely, I am shocked to see Leila in front of me, who is currently holding my eyes open with her fingers, and who is now making a bright blue text float in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Barry, but I can't let you rest any more than this,\" the writing says. \"The royal guards could be on our tail any minute. We need to move.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am reading Leila's text, everything that happened before I fainted suddenly comes back to me."

Come on, let's see if we can get you to take a few steps forward.

Just leave me here, and I'll catch up with you later, I promise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be stupid...\" Leila writes. \"I'm not leaving you behind. If any of the royal guards teleport themselves here and find you in this state, they will kill you in a heartbeat. Give me a moment. I'll try to see if I can remember a technique that I learned from my father a while back.

Once she is finally done with her technique, the pain in my head gets greatly reduced and even though a strong feeling of nausea still remains, it has become much more bearable.\r\n\r\n\"That was incredible!\" I tell Leila, as she is now getting back up. \"It felt almost like you were using magic.

Just as we are about to turn another corner, Gontrok dashes past us at a breathtaking speed and he stops in front of us, blocking our path.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, if it isn't the silver-haired princess and her smart-mouthed prince,\" Gontrok says. \"My orders from the king are to bring the lessathi tinkerer's daughter to him alive and unharmed, but that can wait. That insolent whelp over there had the nerve to call me a coward to my face during our last encounter and I intend to teach him a lesson or two before I--\"\r\n\r\nBefore Gontrok gets to finish what he was saying, Leila makes a very quick dash towards him, aiming both her blades straight for his neck. Gontrok instinctively steps out of the way, but Leila attacks him again, right as he is regaining his footing. After dodging Leila's slashes a few more times, Gontrok gets tired of being on the defensive, and he attempts to grab her with both his hands.\r\n\r\nSeeing that her opponent is finally retaliating, Leila jumps backwards and then she looks Gontrok in the eye, while she makes her blue writing appear in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were supposed to bring me to the king 'alive and unharmed',\" Leila writes. \"Why are you fighting back all of a sudden?\""

And besides, that attack of yours was just for show, wasn't it? Now that I take a better look at your weapons, neither you nor your bodyguard over there have blades sharp enough to pass through a giant's skin, no matter how strong your attacks may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really believe that you can accurately tell how many enchantments a dagger has on it just by looking at it?\" Leila writes. \"Don't you think this overconfidence of yours might end up costing you your life someday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah!\" Gontrok says. \"Someday, maybe. But not today. If you think you've got what it takes to kill me, then why don't we make a little bet? I will stand here in place for one full minute and during this time you can try to slit my throat, cut my head off, or whatever. I won't dodge and I won't defend myself in any way. However... if I am still left standing after that minute passes, you will come with me to visit the king of your own free will, without posing any resistance. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to regret this,\" Leila writes, giving Gontrok a cold stare while she readies her daggers.\r\n\r\nGontrok laughs, and then he grins maliciously at Leila. \r\n\r\n\"We have a deal, then!\" he says."

In fact it wasn't the aura itself that caught my attention, but the flow of magic inside of it that is specific to someone who is currently shapeshifting. The flow is clearly unstable. I've studied how shapeshifting is supposed to work, and none of what he is doing is standard procedure. He must be using some sort of poorly modified version of the normal shapeshifting spell so that he can gain wings and other useful appendages without the need to fully transform himself into a different creature. Maybe there is some way in which I can turn this instability of his aura into an advantage for me?\r\n\r\nAs I am standing there, thinking, Gontrok attacks me again with an extremely quick punch, making me jump behind to dodge him while Leila is once more looking for a good opportunity to flank my opponent. It feels like there are dozens of concurrent thoughts racing through my head while I'm avoiding Gontrok's seemingly endless attacks. Out of all the ideas that are coming to me right now, two in particular seem rather promising, but they both involve using a variation of Leila's father's massage technique to mess with the giant's aura."

If I don't see him trying to close the gap between us too much, then he's probably just going for a feint.

This is unfortunately exactly what Gontrok was waiting for, and as soon as he sees me dodging one of his feints, he immediately follows it up with a punch so hard that it goes right through my head and it shatters my cranium in a single motion."

If the information I have is true, then it should be easy enough to distinguish the fake attacks from the real ones, because whenever he actually wants to hit me, he will get a little closer to me so that his punches can have more of an impact. If I don't see him trying to close the gap between us too much, then he's probably just going for a feint. With this info, I should be able to hold out against him long enough for Leila to find another opening to try and stab him in the eyes again. Let's see if it works."

              Surely enough, after several more strikes coming from Gontrok, my
              suspicions get confirmed and I can now say without a shadow of a
              doubt that he is indeed using the technique I was thinking of.  I
              avoid his attacks for a while longer until Leila finally goes for
              his eyes, forcing him to jump back and to take his focus off me
              momentarily.

As long as I can keep this in mind while I fight him, I should still be one step ahead of him at all times, so there would be no reason to worry about getting hit."

Think!\r\n\r\n\"Ready when you are, princess,\" Gontrok says. \"I'll start counting the sixty seconds as soon as you hit your first attack.\"\r\n\r\nLeila nods, and almost immediately afterwards she dashes towards her adversary in the same way that she did the first time she attacked him, trying to slit his throat with both her daggers. Despite her best efforts, however, Leila's blades are easily stopped by the giant's thick skin and neither of her cuts is deep enough to even draw blood. \r\n\r\n\"Is that all you got?\" Gontrok taunts her. \"And here I was, hoping for an actual challenge! What a disappointment.\"\r\n\r\nAs Leila prepares to hit him again, I suddenly come up with an idea that might just work, but I won't know for sure until I test it. Let's give it a try.\r\n\r\nI move behind Gontrok, I join the fingers of my right hand together and then I use them to hit the back of his neck several times, while closely monitoring the flow of his aura."

If my gut feeling is right, then if I try a variation of Leila's father's massage technique, I might be able to disrupt the giant's aura enough to get him to drop off his feet, which would make him automatically lose his bet with Leila since he's not allowed to move. All I need to do is find the right pressure points."

He knows exactly what you're after, and he isn't afraid to give you what you want in order to avoid raising your suspicions. He wants you to be his loyal dog until the moment when he'll no longer need you, at which point he'll have you executed without a second thought.\""

        text: "\"I've heard enough of this!\" Gontrok says. \"You're not going to help anyone kill the king. I won't let you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that supposed to be a threat?\" Loyrang says, in his characteristic laidback tone. \"Gontrok, my friend... Have you never wondered why I decided to travel together with you when I came across you on the first day of the tournament? Did you really think that I would risk walking side by side all this time with someone that I thought would have even the slightest chance of defeating me in battle? You clearly must not know me very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, first you insult my intelligence, and now you insult my combat prowess?\" Gontrok says, as he seems to barely be able to contain his rage. \"Do you seriously think that you can afford to be so confident just because those weapons of yours are sharp enough to cut through my skin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust me, it's not just because of the sharpness of my weapons that I am being confident,\" Loyrang says. \"If you don't believe me, you're free to test my skills whenever you're ready. Just don't blame me if you lose an arm or two in the process...\"\r\n\r\nGontrok suddenly lets out a laugh, but it's not the kind of laugh that someone lets out when they're being amused by something. It's more the kind of laugh that you would normally expect to hear from someone who is only a few moments away from snapping."

        text: "\"What a day this has been...\" Gontrok says, once he's done laughing. \"First I had to babysit that whiney teleporter guy, then I got taken for a fool by these two chumps, and now my trusted comrade-in-arms tells me that he's about to cut my arms off. And to top it all off, there is this most annoying buzzing sound in the background going on and on and on while I'm trying to talk, and it's PISSING ME OFF!!!\"\r\n\r\nGontrok is right. I'm not sure exactly when it started, but all of the blue crystals that are embedded in the cavern walls around us have been vibrating for a while, and it feels like they're getting louder by the second. Gontrok pauses for a few moments, hoping that the sound might go away by itself, but when he realizes that it's only going to get louder from now on, he raises his voice, probably in an attempt to drown out the noise coming from the crystals."

        text: "\"So, you want to show me how much stronger you are, Loyrang?! Gontrok shouts. \"Is that it? Or maybe your strategy is to fool me into thinking that it's going to be a fair fight but you've instead laid a trap for me on the floor in front of me? I know your type... You're not planning to fight fair at all, are you? Don't try to lie to me; I know what you non-giants are like. You're all the same! Every single one of you! Would it kill you people to fight with at least some shred of dignity? Does honor mean nothing to you? Is there-- ARGH, will this thrice-damned noise never end?! What is wrong with these crystals? Can't you see that I'm trying to have a conversation here?! Be silent, damn you! I said BE QUIET!!!\"\r\n\r\nAs he is shouting those last two words, Gontrok furiously hits one of the crystals from the wall on his left with the side of his fist. Instead of shattering, however, the crystal begins to emit a blue light that is much brighter than the one before, which fills up the whole corridor and effectively blinds us for a few seconds. Then, as we are all slowly regaining our sight, we suddenly hear Gontrok's scream, full of both anger and utter disbelief."

        text: "\"What the hell is this?!\" Gontrok shouts, while showing us his left hand.\r\n\r\nWhat I am now seeing is extremely hard to put into words. It looks as if his left hand had been essentially cut in half, with its pinky finger and its ring finger missing entirely, as well as the two knuckles corresponding to them and the left side of his palm. Yet somehow, his hand looks like it's been that way ever since he was born. Not only is there no blood coming out of the missing fingers, but there is also no scar tissue to be seen. If someone were to see his hand now for the first time, there would be no reason for them to believe that those two missing fingers ever existed.\r\n\r\nBut that is not all... For a fraction of a second, when I first laid eyes upon his hand after the blinding flash of blue light, I was almost convinced that his hand had been like this the whole time. Even though I still have clear memories of his hand being intact only moments ago, I was on the verge of believing that Gontrok's left hand has had only three fingers since the very beginning. As I am struggling to understand how something like this could have happened, Gontrok shouts again, while taking a good look at every person in the room beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you all looking at me like that, you daft fools?!\" Gontrok says, as he is holding up his left hand to make sure that everyone can see it properly. \"Do you not have eyes? I'll ask again. What the HELL is this?!\""

Do you expect us to pity you now? Are you going to tell me that you want me to fight you with one hand behind my back to even the odds?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are taking this joke too far, Loyrang,\" Gontrok says. \"These two fingers disappeared out of the blue after I hit the crystal with them and you know it! You saw it happen with your own eyes! You were all here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gontrok, snap out of it!\" the illusionist says. \"This traitorous bastard must have cast some sort of mind affecting spell on you while we were distracted by the blue light. Listen to me. You've never had more than three fingers on your left hand. It is the way you were born. Don't get fooled by a simple trick like this, damn it!\"\r\n\r\nAs the three royal guards are arguing, Leila pulls me lightly by the sleeve and when I turn to look at her, I can see that she is looking rather distraught.\r\n\r\n\"Barry... please tell me that I'm not going crazy,\" Leila writes. \"You also remember Gontrok having five fingers on his left hand before, right?

As Gontrok screams again, Eiden puts his left hand on the giant's head, making it explode into a million pieces of meat and blood that cover the floor and walls around him.

In Eiden's case, I think he might be connected to the Magium somehow, because those crystals were clearly reacting to his presence.

          conducting while we were in the Magium's territory that I didn't
          really pay much attention to at the time, but I think it might help to
          explain what is happening. When we were spectating Kate's ritual in
          the Beacon of Hope, Arraka kept trying to get the attention of some of
          the lessathi that were in charge of the orphanage. When she did
          eventually manage to get one of them to react to what she was doing
          despite her being in a completely different dimension, she concluded
          that all lessathi must have some sort of natural affinity to the
          Magium, and that this is part of the reason why many of them are so
          good at making these devices that require you to understand magic at a
          very complex level. I think it is also due to this natural affinity to
          the Magium that we were still able to remember the existence of
          Gontrok's fingers. If we were to ask any of our friends about them
          now, I doubt any of them would be able to even imagine a Gontrok that
          ever had five fingers on his left hand."

Once we reach the top of the stairs, we go through the second door that has been left open by Eiden and we enter the same closet room full of buckets and wet rags that we stumbled into during our previous visit to the tower."

I don't get a lot of time to think about this, however, because almost as soon as we exit the closet, we hear the voices of Eiden and the king of Ollendor coming from the voice magnifier tied to the transceiver that is placed in the upper corner of the room, which if I remember correctly is the device that Billy Bob was using before to make announcements to the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"Creator, please understand that I had no intention of going against your wishes!\" the king of Ollendor says. \"It's just that you said you were away on important business and you gave us no way to contact you, so there was no chance for me to discuss my plans with you. I would have never even imagined that you would object to the destruction of the crystal-filled underground corridors!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, it is clearly stated by the third golden rule that the blue crystals are not to be tampered with,\" Eiden says. \"These golden rules have existed ever since Varathia was first founded six hundred years ago and they've been passed down from generation to generation ever since. Surely you must have heard of them?\""

You are on your own.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few more moments of choking sounds, we hear the king beginning to cough violently, suggesting that Eiden might have loosened his grasp on him in order to hear what he has to say.\r\n\r\n\"You...\" the king says, as he is slowly regaining his voice. \"Just for some blue rocks... you would do something like this?

You being strangled nearly to death is something so insignificant that it simply pales in comparison to the ramifications of today's events.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other kings were right...\" says the king of Ollendor. \"You are insane! You cannot be left alive! You are far too much of a threat to us all!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet none of these kings have had the nerve to tell me this to my face, despite having been planning my assassination in secret for the past twenty years...\" Eiden says. \"I will commend you, though, for being the first one to actually tell me this so openly. Perhaps a small reward is in order, to show you how much I appreciate your sincerity. I will leave you now, but you should expect your reward to arrive in this very room within the next few minutes. Goodbye, king of Ollendor.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Eiden teleports away, we hear the king coughing a few more times, and then the transceiver falls completely silent."

I'm sure that second-rate copy of me is going to have the time of her life very soon. Aha-Ahahahahaha!\""

        text: "\"You should consider yourself lucky that the Magium didn't remember your hijinks through its realm and decided to end this universe as well, just to be safe,\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"You do realize that this wasn’t the Magium itself, right? \" Arraka says. \"It was just a fraction of its will, manifested through the crystal, which was most likely awoken due to the destruction of the crystal-filled caverns from the rebel base. It probably didn’t even know who I was or what I did in the Magium’s realm. The only reason why it even reacted to these two losers in the first place was because it could most likely sense from their auras that they’ve been in contact with the Arraka from Selkram’s ritual, and so it must have assumed that she was hiding somewhere in this world. Anyway, the danger’s gone now, so you can relax. Everything's fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not exactly sure how you can tell us to relax when only a fraction of the Magium almost ended our entire world, but I suppose we can at least agree that we should be safe for now,\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"This... is not something that I have calculated,\" the Overseer's green-eyed drone says out of the blue, this time in his normal tone of voice. \"I will need some time to analyze what has happened. In the meantime I would like to ask you to leave this tower. We will continue our previous discussion at a later date.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment!\" Melindra says, as she goes over to the king's dead body and then she removes one of the rings from his fingers. \"Alright, now we can go!\""

        text: "\"Oh, so it was one of the rings after all,\" I tell Melindra. \"I've been looking through his pockets, but I wasn't exactly sure which of the items you needed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I noticed,\" Melindra says. \"And I appreciate the thoughtfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, well... I certainly have a lot of questions to ask, but we should probably talk more once we're back in the rebel base,\" Daren says. \"A lot of people got hurt during the collapse of the caves, and they need all the medical help they can get. Albert should be ready to teleport us at a moment's notice. As you might have guessed, Barry Thundercloud will not be teleporting us any longer, since he is currently being held in custody by the king of the underground's men. Are you ready to leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need to be so stern, Daren!\" Melindra says. \"Have you already forgotten how you almost rushed to the caves under this tower by yourself when you heard from Albert that Barry was teleported here and Gontrok went after him? We still have a little time! Why don't you do what you really came here to do and give your good friend Barry a big hug?\""

        text: "\"Okay, first of all, you shut up,\" Daren tells Melindra. \"And secondly, if nobody else has anything to say, I'd like to call Albert on the transceiver now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, I have just one short question before we go,\" I say. \"Daren, do you remember how many fingers Gontrok had on his left hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Daren says. \"He had three fingers. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to confirm something,\" I say, as Leila and I exchange a quick glance. \"Don't worry about it. You can call Albert now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright, then,\" Daren says, as he pulls out his transceiver and he gives Albert the signal to teleport us.\r\n\r\n\"Am I going crazy, here?\" doctor Reidzek asks Leila in a low voice, as we are all getting closer together, in order to get teleported. \"Didn't Gontrok have five fingers on each of his hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll... explain later,\" Leila writes to him, and then a white light envelops us all, as we are all getting teleported out of the tower and back to the underground tunnels of the rebel base."
