Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\nGolmyck makes a short pause before he continues.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then!\" he says. \"Your first objectives are as follows. You will need to each find a glowing pinecone and bring it to the city of Galamir. Glowing pinecones grow only on the continent of Varathia, so most of you may not know much about them, but they basically look just like regular pinecones, except they start glowing brightly when you take them in your hand. There is no time limit for completing these objectives, but the earlier you bring the pinecones to their destination, the quicker you can begin your next objectives, which will give you a head start, compared to the latecomers. Lastly, I would like to mention that in this round you will be allowed to form teams with other participants. A team can have as many members as you want, and if you all confirm that you are part of the same team when you reach Galamir, you will pass the first round together, as long as you have at least one pinecone with you. That would be all for now. Good luck!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?!\" Hadrik shouts. \"He can't be serious! How can they even call this a mage tournament with objectives like that? What's next, are they going to tell us to go pick some flowers?\""

Going to the hospital now is out of the question without Rose to guide us, and it would be prudent to get our backpacks before we head towards the castle.\"\r\n\r\nDaren pauses.\r\n\r\n\"One of us will also have to deliver the news of Rose's death to her siblings when we get there,\" he says."

She will be missed, but in the end, she's just another woman who only loves me for my money and my good looks! I should have little trouble replacing her. There are plenty of other fish in the sea!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughs.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, grab your drinks, everyone,\" Enrique says. \"Today, we toast for Rose: the most beautiful and kind-hearted woman I've ever known, and the love of my life. May she always be remembered, and may she continue to live in our hearts, from now and forever more!\"\r\n\r\nAfter hearing Enrique's speech, we all decided to take our wine glasses, and to join in on the toast. \r\n\r\nThe next half of an hour was spent talking about Rose. We told Enrique of the adventures we've had with her for the past week, and he told us of their years together at the mansion. It was clear that none of us were in the mood for drinking, or telling stories, but it didn't matter."

Rose did not deserve this.\r\n\r\nWhile we talked, it was becoming more and more obvious that despite his cheerful act, Enrique was likely the one who was suffering the most from Rose's loss. However, whenever he talked about Rose, his smile would become genuine, and even Kate had managed to smile once or twice during our long conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen time began to run out, we told Enrique that we needed to be heading towards the castle, and we each went to get our backpacks before starting on our new journey. As we were about to set out, Enrique took us aside for a moment to have a word with us, away from the kids.\r\n\r\n\"There is something that I did not dare to ask in front of the children,\" Enrique says. \"I saw that you did not bring Rose's body with you when you returned to the mansion, so I assumed the worst, but I need to know. How did Rose die?\""

We left Rose to talk with her little brother and sister, while we each went to our own rooms to get our backpacks. When we got back to the yard, we noticed that there was now also another person standing next to Rose, besides her two siblings. \r\n\r\nAs we got closer, we could see that this person was a man as tall as Daren, with a well-toned muscular build, wearing a shirt that was half unbuttoned, with long black hair that reached his shoulders, and a bristly moustache covering his whole upper lip. On his left hip, he was wearing a golden scabbard that appeared to be holding a rather expensive sword, at least judging by the multitude of gems decorating its hilt. The man seemed to be in the middle of a discussion with Rose, but when he saw us approach, he gave us all one long look before he started speaking again.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I see you have befriended a few of the tournament's participants on your latest journey,\" the man tells Rose. \"Could you please introduce me to your new friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\" Rose says, and then she turns to us. \"This is my ex-husband, Enrique. He was just telling me what Suzie and Kevin had been up to for these past few weeks, since he's been checking up on them every now and then while I've been away.\"\r\n\r\nRose now turns to Enrique, as she introduces us to him, one by one."

You're only going to a meeting. It's not like we'll never see each other again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember to keep that transceiver I gave you close to you at all times,\" Daren tells Rose. \"If things get ugly, and we are unable to come back, we'll give you a call.\"\r\n\r\n\"There goes Daren again, with his usual optimism!\" Rose says, smiling. \"I'm sure you'll be fine. The king just wants to have a talk with you, that's all. Otherwise he would have sent an arrest warrant, not an invitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope you are right,\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the entrance is that way,\" Rose says. \"I think we've spent enough time standing around in front of the castle.

As we approach the entrance, Daren signals the guards to let us through, and once they confirm our identities, they open the doors. We all step inside, slowly, as the gates slam shut behind us."

The castle's windows looked as if they were supposed to have precious gems encrusted on their frames, but the gems were all missing. It also seemed as if several decorations had been ripped off from the towers. \r\n\r\nThe castle's interior looks even worse. The hallways are completely empty. There are no paintings on the walls, no carpets on the ground and no vases on the tables. The place looks more like a dungeon than a castle. There aren't even any guards patrolling the hallways. I'm almost starting to wonder if we didn't somehow end up in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n\"This feels like the ogre fort, all over again,\" Hadrik says, as he opens Arraka's amulet. \"Hey, you! Arraka! Are you sensing any guards hiding invisibly around here? Answer me!\"\r\n\r\nArraka makes no sound, acting as if she weren't hearing a word of what Hadrik is saying.\r\n\r\n\"Giving me the silent treatment, eh?\" Hadrik says, with a grin.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Kate freezes the whole area around us, making it look as if we were inside some frozen palace from a fairy tale.\r\n\r\n\"The area is clear,\" Kate says. \"There's no one surrounding us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great,\" Daren says. \"Now unfreeze the damn hallway before anyone sees--\""

I go catch up to Flower, who seems to have stopped in front of a wall, not far from our original position. After looking at the wall from different angles, the girl starts to knock on the bricks, one by one, as if she were looking for something.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything special about this wall?\" I ask her.\r\n\r\n\"Shush, I'm trying to listen!\" Flower says, as she continues to knock on the bricks.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more seconds, the girl finally seems to have found what she was looking for, and she starts to pull one of the bricks out of the wall with both her hands. As she puts the brick down, I see that inside the hole left in the wall, there is a small wooden lever.\r\n\r\n\"Wow, you sure know your stuff, huh?\" I tell Flower.\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\" Flower says. \"Petal and I have been through dozens of ruins with hidden passages before!

We both go beyond the wall, and enter a small dark room that has a stone pedestal in the middle of it. Upon closer examination, it seems that there is some writing on the top of the pedestal, but it is too dark to make out what it says.\r\n\r\nFlower makes a small orb of fire, which she sends floating above the pedestal, so I can read the writing on it. Now that I get a clear look at it, it appears that the text is written in the Common language.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\" Flower asks.\r\n\r\n\"It says: 'Place your palm on this pedestal, if you like discovering secrets.' \"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I love discovering secrets!\" Flower says, and she quickly places her palm on top of the stone pedestal."

I heard that the first thing you did when you moved into the royal castle was to strip it of anything of value, sell everything, and then give the money to the poor.

But the size of Varathia is nowhere near the size of any other continent in the world. If anything, it's more of an island, really. In fact, if I recall correctly, that is how I named this place after the still winter. The island of Varathia. The island of freedom. Why did people start calling this a continent, I wonder? Was it because you felt left out, when you discovered that there was a world outside of Varathia? Was it perhaps to satisfy your own egos, fooling yourselves into believing that you could compare with the civilizations from the other continents?\" \r\n\r\n\"Creator, please,\" the ambassador says. \"I don't know what your affiliation is with these mages, but they have done us a great harm.

I haven't really been tinkering with devices as often as I would have liked since I became king, but I find that this place always relaxes me after a heated discussion such as the one that I had with the ambassador earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said that you had something you wanted to discuss with us in private?\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" Golmyck says. \"Let's start with your giant friend over there, who is currently shapeshifting into a dwarf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it!\" Hadrik says. \"I should have known that it was all too good to be true. Is this the part where you kick me out of the tournament?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\" Golmyck says. \"The rules of the tournament never explicitly stated that giants were not allowed in the tournament. We only avoided inviting giants to this contest because of the overwhelming advantage you would get from both your size and your strength. However, given that you have willingly shrunk yourself to the size of a dwarf, we have decided to make an exception in your case. You will be permitted to participate in this tournament, as long as you do not shapeshift yourself into anything bigger than what would normally be possible for a dwarf. And also, since you seem to be so fond of your dwarf form, this is how you will present yourself to all other participants from now on. I don't want any of the other mages finding out that you are in fact a giant. Are we clear?\""

There is no need for you to go into the arena.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell there isn't!\" Hadrik shouts. \"Do you think I came all the way here to go looking for pinecones? I came here to fight, damn it! I swear, if you don't let me fight in this arena, I'm going to start thrashing the whole neighborhood until your guards throw me in there themselves!\""

I, myself, am not much better than my predecessors, because I've barely done anything conclusive to address the problem since I moved into this castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" Daren asks. \"Why haven't you done anything? You are the king. You could do so much to help these people...\""

Make no mistake, I am not the only person with an information network in this city. And the control I have over my kingdom is in fact a lot more limited than you might think.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who are these people that are keeping tabs on you, exactly?\" Hadrik asks. \"The other kings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in a way,\" Golmyck says. \"The ones in charge of keeping an eye on me are a group of lessathi who are allies with the other kings, but who work independently. They control a vast underground network of spies and assassins who rival my own, and their purpose is to make sure that I don't take too many initiatives that might 'endanger' the future of Varathia. If I try to take a decision as bold as freeing all of the slaves in my city, I may well get assassinated even before I manage to sign the decree.\""

Their territories have been getting smaller and smaller due to the increasing number of monster attacks in recent years, so their negotiators have become a little less rigid lately. I promised to provide them shelter within our walls, on the condition that they help us clear the lessathi threat from our city. I will have a meeting in this very room with one of the representatives of the animal kingdom in a few days, where we will discuss this exact topic. If everything goes well, it is very likely that we will be reaching an agreement in the next few months.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what you're trying to say here is that you've got everything under control, and that we should no longer interfere?\" Hadrik asks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, exactly,\" Golmyck says. \"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of the whole situation, in case you'd be tempted to do something rash again.\""
