From our perspective, it would look as if you were moving really fast, though. The advantage of slowing down time is that you can also interact with other people, while doing it. I think you might also be able to un-slow people from time, in the same way that you can unfreeze them from time, as long as they are somewhere near you, but I'm not completely sure if that comes as a time weaver power, or if it's just a really complex spell. Aside from these powers, I can't say that I'm aware of any others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" Rose says. \"I can't seem to be able to reverse time at all, but maybe I'll find a way to use that time-slowing spell you mentioned. Let me give it a try.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after her conversation with Arraka, Rose begins to test her powers, while Kate and Flower are helping her with some indications. In the meantime, Daren and Hadrik are apparently still walking around, trying to see if they can find anything unusual that could help them spot a weakness in the ritual. As I am looking around, to see what everyone is doing, I suddenly realize that Leila hasn't participated in any of our discussions, so far, and she has barely even moved from her spot since the ritual started. At the moment, she is just looking at the ground, while avoiding making eye-contact with any of us."

Come to think of it, she was also at the Beacon, so it wouldn't be too surprising if she got a similar ritual to that of Kate. That is not good... Kate might be strong enough to endure the emotional trauma caused by such a trial, but what about Leila? Maybe I should go talk to her, and see how she's holding out.\r\n\r\n\"Leila, is everything alright?\" I say, as I get a little closer to her.\r\n\r\nLeila looks surprised, when she hears my voice. I think she has gotten used to being ignored in these situations, due to her quiet nature and her generally weak sense of presence.\r\n\r\nShe raises her head, to look me in the eyes, and then she nods, slightly, in order to answer my question.\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Leila writes. \"Just a little shaken up, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to talk about it?...\" I ask her.\r\n\r\nAgain, Leila looks at me surprised, for a second, but then she smiles faintly, as she writes a new text in the air, in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"Not now,\" Leila writes. \"But maybe later...\""

When we all turn around to find out who the voice belonged to, we see Cutthroat Dave, with sweat all over his face, looking around him, confused, as he's trying to figure out what's going on. I suddenly realize that Cutthroat Dave must have been the person watching us invisibly from afar that Arraka and the God of Time were talking about, earlier. With all the crazy stuff that's been going on since the prophecy started, I had completely forgotten about him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so you were our invisible stalker!\" Melindra says, with a smirk, as she casts a spell on the cutthroat, to lift him in the air. \"Why don't you come over here, so we can see you a little better?\"\r\n\r\nShe then makes the air currents slowly carry Cutthroat Dave towards our position, as he is struggling in vain to break himself free.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go, you wench!\" Cutthroat Dave says, as he sends some of his knives to attack Melindra.\r\n\r\nMelindra uses a wind spell to effortlessly deflect the knives, and then she continues to bring the cutthroat closer to us."

The first thing that catches my attention is that there is one very large black tower in every corner of the city,  and on top of each of these four towers, there is an incredible amount of magical energy, that can be seen even with the naked eye. The energy has a purple color, and it is moving wildly in every direction, as if it were trying to escape its prison. On each side of these thousand foot tall towers, there are big, floating platforms, that keep going up and down at a slow speed, and they seem to be carrying hundreds of people towards the levels of the towers that they need to reach."

Why didn't the time reverse itself to save her, like it saved you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only reason why the time didn't get reversed for Rose was because of the revenant spell cast on her before she died,\" the revenant says. \"The Magium does not care who gets to inhabit a time weaver's body, as long as it can still fulfill its purpose of delivering the prophecy. Given that I was already scheduled to take Rose's body after her death, there was no need for the time reversal spell to activate, so I became the time weaver, in her place.\"\r\n\r\n\"So... Rose would have still been alive, if it wasn't for you?...\" Daren asks."

She wasn't the one who asked to be put in this body, nor was she the one who asked to serve the God of Death. We can't really blame her for any of this.\"\r\n\r\nShe then goes over to the revenant, and she grabs both her hands, gently, as she looks into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" Kate says. \"I'm not sure what to call you. 'Revenant' sounds too cold, but I am also aware that you are not the Rose I know. However, if there's anything of Rose left within you, like you said, then please, come travel with us. Forget about the God of Death. You don't need to let him control you any longer. We can try to hide from him together, or we could fight him, or... something. You don't have to go through all of this alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe revenant pulls her hands away from Kate, and she takes one step back, as her expressionless gaze momentarily turns into one of sadness and regret.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" the revenant says. \"I am not who you think I am. You should avoid trying to get any closer to me, for your own safety. I was not lying when I said that I would kill you in a heartbeat, if my master ordered me to. My loyalty towards the God of Death will always come first, and you need to understand that. If you put too much trust in me, you're only going to end up getting hurt. It is the Rose part of me that is warning you to stay away from me. Can you understand that?...\""

That way, there should be no reason for him to bear any resentment towards your group.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see...\" Melindra says.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" the revenant says, \"I do not think that the God of Death will ask me anything upon my return. From his point of view, nothing will have happened, since time will remain frozen until I come back. He will likely continue to ignore me, just as he's been doing ever since I first contacted him, and I will be forced to keep waiting in one of his temples, until he sees fit to give me an order.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's ignoring you?\" Kate asks. \"But... why?\""

He even tried to kill me a few times, but he gave up after he saw that it was impossible to do so. Currently, I am not allowed to leave the temple that I entered when I first contacted him, and he is keeping me in the dark about most of his plans, out of fear that I might leak the information to the God of Time.\"\r\n\r\nArraka laughs.\r\n\r\n\"That does sound just like him!\" she says. \"Ulruk has always been very paranoid when it came to the God of Time. I can only imagine how shocked he was when he found a time weaver right on his doorstep, revenant or no. You'd better find yourself a hobby, because you're probably going to be sitting in that temple for a long time.\""

        text: "\"Yes, that was the reason,\" the revenant says. \"Like I said before, the spell that brought me into this world was designed to implant a lot of the God of Death's knowledge into my mind, and amongst that knowledge, there was also some information about the stat devices, and how they work. In short, the temporary stat boost that gets activated with your secret code is entirely dependent upon a brief timer which won't set itself off as long as the world is frozen in time. However, since you managed to activate it right before the time froze, the timer has frozen as well, thus granting you extra hearing capabilities for the whole duration of this time-freezing spell.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, when you called me, the time wasn't frozen, yet?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the revenant says. \"But I knew that it would freeze in a matter of seconds, because I had a few time-freezing spells go off without my control, right before I was put in the trance. Something similar to this also happened before the previous time I called you, except back then the time only froze once, without my control, and I was not put in a trance during that time, so I knew that it was only a small test, before the main event. This is why I asked you to keep your communications channel open, so that I could later tell you to activate the code, right before the prophecy started. Having the code activated isn't enough, though. In order for my plan to work, you would also need to have four points or more, already invested in hearing, so that together with the bonus points offered by the secret code, you would get a level of seven, in that stat.

Otherwise, even if you have available points to spend, the stat device won't let you manually add any extra points, over the maximum level of four. Sadly, it seems that we will need to go with my secondary plan. There is also another way to find out the information we need, but it is less effective. Does anyone in this group have a particularly keen magical sense?\""

Not only that, but this same prophecy will be delivered to you and the others at least two more times, before the events prophesized will come to pass, in order to announce you if any progress has been made, towards your goal of averting the disaster. The reason why Arraka said that you were the most likely ones to influence the prophecy is because the time weavers always visit their targets in order of priority, which means that your group may have the most decisive role in the events to come, depending on your choices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh...\" Daren says. \"I'm not sure if I should be feeling reassured that we will be having a good chance of stopping the calamity, or worried that we'll likely be right in the middle of it, when it happens.

Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling of anxiousness that could be seen in the revenant's eyes is now turning into one of relief. Those human emotions do not last long, however, because soon afterwards, the look in her eyes turns back to the empty, expressionless gaze that she had before.\r\n\r\n\"Wow, it sure has been a while since we finished our first trials,\" Daren says, after some time. \"I wonder why it's taking so long for the second stage to start...\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you why,\" Arraka says. \"It's because you shmucks gave Selkram so much raw material to work with in the first stage, that he's still busy converting it all into energy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?...\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Your negative emotions!\" Arraka says. \"That's the raw material that Selkram is using to convert into magical energy. And while you losers were busy repeating those rituals over and over, sinking into the depths of despair or cursing the God of Time, you were giving him exactly what he wanted. Honestly, I think he got so much energy from you people, that he might not even NEED a second stage from your group. I guess we'll see about that soon enough.\""

Come on, Hadrik, let's try interacting with more of these frozen insects and trees. Maybe we'll be able to find one that isn't protected by an invisible, impenetrable shield, so we can finally cancel this damned time-freezing spell.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Daren and Hadrik got to patrol the area for quite a while longer, they didn't manage to find anything useful. Eventually, a bright white light covered our area once again, and this time, I could feel my whole body being transported somewhere else, instead of only my consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen the light fades away, we all find ourselves in the middle of a city which is... unusual, to say the least. The first thing that catches my attention is that there is one very large black tower in every corner of the city,  and on top of each of these four towers, there is an incredible amount of magical energy, that can be seen even with the naked eye. The energy has a purple color, and it is moving wildly in every direction, as if it were trying to escape its prison. On each side of these thousand foot tall towers, there are big, floating platforms, that keep going up and down at a slow speed, and they seem to be carrying hundreds of people towards the levels of the towers that they need to reach."

              Leaving these strange, tall buildings aside, what is even more
              peculiar is what's happening directly above us. Currently, there
              are hundreds of metal, horseless carriages, flying through the
              air, with people inside them. While these carriages are flying
              around, there are large holographic screens floating above us,

              ones that were created by Golmyck's illusion-casting device, when
              he announced our first objectives. The message that keeps getting
              repeated is: 'All non-lessathi citizens are to present themselves
              to the military reserve area immediately. We are under attack. I
              repeat, we are under attack!'.

Cutthroat Dave keeps flailing his arms and legs around, in the air, in the hopes that he could break himself free from Melindra's spell, but eventually he reaches our position, and Melindra gives him a good long look, before she addresses him again.  \r\n\r\n\"Why are you so upset, cutthroat?\" Melindra says. \"Is it because you accidentally cancelled your invisibility spell when you panicked earlier? Or was your ritual really so terrifying that you still haven't gotten over it? How does a lowlife like you get access to such a sophisticated invisibility spell, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"As if I'd be stupid enough to tell you where I got the elixir from,\" Cutthroat Dave says. \"I'm way too smart for you to be playing your mind games with me, you understand?\""

In her right hand, she is now holding a small flask, which is closed with a cork and has a green liquid inside, while in her left hand she is holding two furled scrolls that are likely single-use teleportation scrolls, like the one that the cutthroat had used before.\r\n\r\n\"You thieving whore!\" Cutthroat Dave shouts, furiously, as Melindra makes the flask float in the air, in front of her, while she unfurls the scrolls, to take a quick look at them. \"Give me back my items, or I promise that you'll end up full of holes!\""

Your friend in armor over there was hailed as a legendary mage too, and that still didn't stop me from bringing him to his knees. What makes you think you're so special?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" Arraka says. \"The healer lost a fight against this weakling? Ahahahahahaha! That's one of the most hilarious things I've ever heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you calling a weakling, you crappy piece of jewelry?\" Cutthroat Dave says.\r\n\r\n\"He called me a piece of jewelry!\" Arraka says. \"Ahahahahaha!

As I suspected, the scrolls seem to be tailored specifically for the cutthroat, and they can't be cast by anyone other than him. I can't say much about the elixir, but considering how Cutthroat Dave went out of his way to get scrolls that would work only for him, I wouldn't be surprised if this green liquid acted in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nMelindra gives me a smirk, when she sees that I'm done reading the scrolls.\r\n\r\n\"As you've probably figured out by now, those scrolls are completely useless to us,\" Melindra tells me. \"The elixir might work, but I personally wouldn't risk it. Who knows what nasty side-effects it might have, if it were used by the wrong person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's still better than nothing,\" I say. \"I'll keep it for now.\"\r\n\r\nI then put the flask inside my backpack, and I tear the teleportation scrolls into pieces, to make sure that the cutthroat won't be able to use them anymore."

As the woman gets closer to us, I see that her eyes are pitch black, and that she has a very familiar looking malicious grin on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well...\" the woman says, as she looks towards Arraka's amulet. \"It looks like Selkram sent me a little present. You're all coming from the future, I presume? Let me check my future self's aura, for a second. Wow... So, you're five thousand years older than me, huh? I guess I must have gotten really senile with old age, if I managed to get myself captured in an amulet by a glorified circus troupe. Seriously, what even are you people? A little girl dressed like a clown? A giant masquerading as a dwarf?  A woman dressed in pajamas? It's like you're trying to compete for the most ridiculously dressed wizard group of the century.\""

Oh, man, this would be so much funnier if it weren't so sad at the same time. Is this really where I'll end up in five thousand years? Trapped in an amulet, while I'm forced to play the role of some clown girl's pet? What kind of a cruel joke has my destiny played on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, you moron!\" the Arraka from the amulet says. \"This is your one chance to fix your pathetic past. I mean, your future. Don't blow it! Set me free from this amulet, and we can make all those self-proclaimed gods pay for banishing us to this realm. They might have beaten us alone, but together, we'll be unstoppable! We will kill every single one of the gods from this cheap copy of a world, and then we'll go back to my real world, and kill them all over again.

You might have forgotten this, due to your old age, but I haven't yet grown as senile as you. Do you seriously expect me to believe that once you get out of that amulet, you will seek to ally yourself with me? Don't make me laugh. I know exactly what you're thinking. As soon as you'll get out of there, the first thing you'll do is to attack me, since I am by far the biggest threat to your existence. And with all the knowledge you've been amassing in those five thousand years, you may as well end up beating me. Why would I take the risk? It's much easier for me to just leave you inside that amulet to rot, until I can find a way to get rid of you for good.

Arraka was clearly caught unaware, and she's trying to push back the flames with her hands, as she's struggling to keep hold of her magical shield. The whole ground below her is quickly turning into lava, while the banshee looks like she is getting slowly pushed back, by the incredible force of the magical flames that just keep on pouring. Eventually, she is forced to teleport away, fifty feet above her current location, which causes the flames to immediately stop.\r\n\r\nThen, completely out of the blue, a familiar looking dragon made out of magma appears right next to us, and in the next second, we find ourselves being teleported away from the city streets, along with him. As we take a quick look around to see where the dragon Tyrath transported us, we realize that we are now situated in a large building with a very high ceiling, and from the looks of it, the whole construction surrounding us has been coated with seredium dust.

If I were to take a guess, based on the important looking clothing of these individuals, I'd wager that these must be the people ruling this city, who were in an emergency meeting discussing about the city being attacked, before we interrupted them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the middle of the amphitheater, where the dragon and our group are currently standing, there are also quite a few human mages gathered, all dressed in traditional wizard clothing, along with a few women who are dressed in wizard robes as well. A particularly old man with a long white beard, who seems to be the person presiding over the meeting, is now addressing Tyrath from an elevated platform, speaking to him in a tone that is somehow both polite and condescending at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Who are these... strangely dressed wizards that you've brought before the lessathi high council, king of all dragons?\" the old man says. \"I thought we'd made it clear that this meeting was supposed to be held behind closed doors.

I've fought her soon after she first made her appearance, yesterday, and I can assure you that she is not an enemy to be trifled with. My whole army of dragons was completely powerless before her. Only I was powerful enough to hold her back, but not enough to actually defeat her. You should already have an idea of the extent of her powers, now that she's attacked your city as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you know how dire the situation is, then why do you bring uninvited guests in the middle of this very important meeting?\" the old lessathi says. \"What benefit could they possibly bring to us, in such circumstances?\"\r\n\r\n\"These people are not what they seem,\" Tyrath says. \"I overheard Arraka saying that one of them was a time weaver, while I was making my way towards this hall. And if you look closely, you will see that the aura coming from that amulet around the little girl's neck is eerily similar to that of Arraka. So similar, in fact, that I would be tempted to say that the two of them are somehow the same person. The Arraka we know was about to kill them all, before I intervened.

Was it worth it to kill so many innocent people just to save this small group?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if my flames hadn't killed them, they would have most certainly gotten killed by Arraka a few moments later,\" Tyrath says. \"Your civilians were practically already dead from the moment when she stepped foot in that area. There were hundreds of your flying metal vehicles crashed into the nearby houses when I arrived, and Arraka hadn't even started her rampage, yet. Every moment wasted arguing here will mean the death of a hundred more of your civilians, until we manage to put together a plan of attack that has some realistic chance of success.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have to agree with Tyrath that arguing any further will get us nowhere,\" the old lessathi says. \"Please sit down, councilman Hrelezar.

You might as well give them some swords and shields to fight with, because that's the most you'll be able to get out of those troops from now on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You called the other Arraka a past version of yourself...\" Tyrath says. \"Does this mean that you're coming from the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impressive, Tyrath!\" Arraka says. \"I never knew that you had mastered basic logic at such a young age. I guess that's why the other dragons made you their king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare me your insipid humor and answer me this,\" Tyrath says. \"Why have you come here? Why were you fighting the Arraka from our time? Did you come here to avert some great crisis, or did you simply happen to arrive in this place by pure chance?\""

        text: "There is a short pause, after I ask my question, during which neither of us says anything.\r\n\r\n\"You want me to tell you how you can kill a god?...\" Arraka says, as she seems to still be recovering from the shock of what I've just asked her.\r\n\r\nShe waits for a few more seconds, to try and figure out if I'm joking or not, and when she finally understands that I'm being serious, she starts to laugh. \r\n\r\nShe laughs, and she laughs, as loud as she can, with all three of her voices, and it doesn't look like she's planning to stop anytime soon. However, I am not upset. This isn't one of her usual, mocking laughs. This laughter is one of excitement. She is enjoying this.\r\n\r\nArraka's laugh manages to grab the attention of everyone in the area, and they're now all looking at us, curiously. I pay them no mind, and I keep waiting patiently for Arraka to stop laughing. When she finally falls silent, she waits for a few more seconds, and then she gives me her answer.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, my boy...\" Arraka says. \"I thought you'd never ask!\"\r\n\r\n-----End of book 2-----"
