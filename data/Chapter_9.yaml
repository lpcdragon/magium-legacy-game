Flower is leading the way again, but this time she looks a lot less confident than before, and there's definitely some uneasiness in her voice as she speaks to us.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, so we'll need to follow this path for the next few hours, until we reach the first crossroads,\" the girl says. \"After that, there isn't really a path to follow anymore, so you're going to have to stick close to me if you don't want to get lost. If you want to take food breaks, just tell me and we'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Flower,\" Kate interrupts her. \"Why did you agree to come with us to the ogre stronghold? Isn't it a little dangerous even for you to be heading straight into monster territory like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yeah, but if I didn't agree to come with you, Eleya would have killed you...\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\" Kate asks. \"If the fox killed us, then our blood wouldn't have been on your hands. Why would you go so far out of your way to help a group of complete strangers? Why not just let her kill us and go on about your business?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know... I just... couldn't...\"\r\n\r\nKate looks at her for a few seconds, and then she smiles faintly.\r\n\r\n\"I see...\" she says. \"Flower, I believe we may have started off on the wrong foot this morning. Allow me to rectify that.\""

Either name will do!\"\r\n\r\nFlower takes a few steps back and is now starting to panic.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" she says. \"I've never really been accepted into a group before. I have no idea what you're supposed to say in these situations!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's okay, Flower,\" Kate says. \"You don't need to say anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Flower says, as she starts to calm down. \"Well, that's a relief!\""

Petal always told me that I am learning magic at a much faster rate than should be humanly possible. Is this because I'm an ethereal too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! The ethereal plane is closer in nature to the magical plane than the earthen plane is. For this reason, your unique perspective allows you to understand magic much more naturally than the rest of us. Being an ethereal does not grant you magical powers upon birth, but those that are also born as mages are fated to become extremely powerful. This is why the lessathi from the Beacon of Hope made it their mission to capture as many ethereal orphans as possible, in the hopes that their experiments would have a greater chance of success. My friend Diane and her brother were both ethereals, and they turned out to be quite the prodigies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'm finally starting to understand why Petal was so surprised to find me inside my own mind when she first awakened,\" Flower says.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to venture a guess,\" Kate says, \"I'd say that your unexpected fusion with the banshee's soul also came as a result of your rather unique circumstances. Normally, a banshee would find the soul defenseless when she invades her host's mind, but you must have been waiting for her, armed and ready. Given that you had the terrain advantage, she had no choice but to settle for a compromise.\""

Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh gods, you must have had it so much worse than I did! At least I had Petal's experience to rely on when we were being chased down by banshee hunters. She's taught me a lot of survival tips that have come in handy along the years. Would you like me to share some of them with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, I suppose it couldn't hurt...\"\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" Flower says, as her cheerful smile returns to her face once again. \"I'll try to remember everything I know on the way to the ogre stronghold. Come on, follow me! We can talk more while we walk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ethereals, huh?\" Arraka says to herself, while we start our long march towards our objective. \"That's a pretty cool sounding name. I might actually start using it myself from now on!\""

During this time, Daren and Hadrik started a bit of a competition to see which one of them could tell the most interesting story from their adventures, while Kate and Flower started sharing their similar life experiences with each other, which seemed to bring them a little closer together.\r\n\r\nOnce we reached the crossroads, around noon, we all stopped in our tracks, and Daren started addressing Rose, with a serious look on his face:\r\n\r\n\"Rose, I think you should take this path and head to your hometown as soon as possible. Don't worry about us and the collars. We'll be fine! The sick people in your town are all waiting for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"She can't leave...\" Kate says. \"Remember what the leopard told us before we left? If any two of the collars get further away than three miles from each other, then all of us will start to get electrical shocks of increasing intensity surging throughout our bodies. If the collars get more than four miles away from each other, then we'll all get killed. The lessathi were the ones who originally designed these devices, and this was a measure they took to keep their prisoners in check. Rose, I'm so sorry... I did not know it would come to this. I should have tried to stop you when you offered to come with me yesterday. This is all my fault...\""

Even they weren't powerful enough to kill her outright, but they managed to cast a very complex spell on her, which forbids her to possess any of the humanoid races.

Even if I were to throw Arraka somewhere far away, she'd just break out of the amulet and find her way to me sooner or later. And then it wouldn't be all over just for me and Petal, it may well be the end for the entire continent, or maybe even the world...\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" I tell her. \"You're saying that you have to keep Arraka under constant supervision, so that you can dispel her explosion spell before she fully channels it, but what happens when you sleep?\""

Flower volunteered to take first watch, and then she immediately went to climb the highest hill, to get a good view of the entire valley. As she passed me by, I could sense her aura weakening considerably, and the banshee's aura becoming a lot stronger. Does this mean that the girl went to sleep and left the banshee in charge of the night shift? If that is so, then this would be the perfect opportunity to get to know the banshee a bit, before we reach the ogre stronghold tomorrow. \r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to sleep, Barry?\" Rose asks me, as she sees me just standing there."

If you have a bone to pick with me, healer, then I would be more than happy to show you that I'm not bluffing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will take you up on that offer, banshee,\" Daren says, as he pulls out his sword. \"Let's see if you fight as well as you run your mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daren, wait!\" I shout, as I place myself between the two of them. \"Do you plan to kill the girl along with the banshee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just because the sword can't lock onto the banshee's aura by itself does not mean I can't do it manually,\" Daren says. \"I can still kill the banshee without harming the girl if I focus hard enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you gone mad?\" I ask him. \"How do you expect to properly target the banshee's aura if the sword can't do it by itself? You're almost guaranteed to fail!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I do, then it would still be a better fate for the girl than to live her whole life chained to an evil spirit.\""

However, it is also said that she went soft ever since she fused with this little girl we see before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl I share the body with has been threading the line between asset and liability for far too long,\" Illuna says. \"Her natural magical talents made her a particularly powerful ally, but her whims overwhelmed her judgment more often than not, and she repeatedly put us into mortal danger because of this. Her decision to help these mages infiltrate your stronghold was the final straw, and it made me realize that I needed to rid myself of her quick, before she would become the end of me.\""

        text: "\"And how do you plan on doing that?\" the shaman asks.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of several shamanistic rituals that could help me with my soul fusion problem,\" the banshee says. \"I only require some time to study in your library, and I am sure that I will find a way to eliminate the girl for good, without harming myself in the process.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in exchange for this favor, you offer us your loyalty?\" the shaman asks.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"Then I require you to do one more thing to prove that you are being sincere,\" the shaman says, with a wicked grin. \"You'll have to execute your friends from that cage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sadly, I cannot do that,\" the banshee says. \"Killing them now would result in all of our deaths.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" the shaman asks.\r\n\r\n\"Those collars that they are wearing have been placed around their necks by the great golden fox, who is also the one who sent them here to steal your sacred chalice,\" Illuna says. \"They are made in such a manner that if the humans die, the collars explode, and those explosions would be powerful enough to easily level your fort and kill all of your warriors. The fox took this extreme measure to make sure that you all get eliminated even if the humans fail their mission.\""

        text: "\"Hmm...\" the shaman says, as he strokes his chin. \"I recognize these collars. They were made by the lessathi of old. I know for a fact that these devices had some very dangerous self-destruct mechanisms set in place in case the prisoners wearing them misbehaved.\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses.\r\n\r\n\"What do you propose we do with them, then?\" he asks the banshee.\r\n\r\n\"We wait,\" Illuna says. \"The fox gave them five days to complete their quest. If they do not return in five days, she will assume that they abandoned their mission, and they will die by electrocution. In this case, the self-destruct mechanism in the collars will not get activated.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've said enough,\" the shaman says. \"It's clear that you hold no attachment to your former allies. You are welcome to use our library as much as you please, Illuna of the sacred woods massacre. We will discuss your payment after you rid yourself of the girl. As for these humans, I have a teleportation spell that can easily transport them into their cell, as long as they don't move from their position for a while. If you confirm that you can still hold onto that cage, I will start casting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My cage will last for at least another few minutes,\" Illuna says. \"However, I have one more warning to give you. That dwarf possesses a giant's strength and could easily break through the walls of your prison without any weapons. I suggest you transport them into one of the cells that have a paralysis spell cast on them. I've visited this stronghold before, when it was owned by goblins, and I remember that there was at least one such cell on the lower levels of the main building.\""

        text: "\"You remember correctly, banshee,\" the shaman says. \"Very well, then. I will send them to one of the paralysis cells.\"\r\n\r\nHe then starts casting his teleportation spell, and our bodies start to slowly vibrate, while we get covered in a bright white light.\r\n\r\n\"You bloody traitor!\" Hadrik says, as he tries to bend the cage's bars with his bare hands. \"I can't believe you actually told them about my giant's strength!\"\r\n\r\n\"Illuna, how could you do this?\" Rose asks the banshee, as a tear drops from her eye. \"I trusted you. Flower trusted you. How could you betray us all like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are far too trusting for your own good, Rose,\" Illuna says, with a frozen look in her eyes. \"I already warned you not to consider me your ally. You should have listened to your healer when you had the chance. Now you will pay the price for your foolishness.\"\r\n\r\nThe banshee's cold look and Rose's tears are the last things I see before everything fades to black and we all get teleported to what may well become our final destination."
