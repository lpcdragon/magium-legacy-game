        text: "\"Daren?...\" Hadrik says. \"Are you okay there, buddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Daren says. \"Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\nHe then throws his sword about a dozen feet in front of him while he walks, and afterwards he extends his hand towards it while he continues to move forward. Once he reaches the sword, he picks it up from the ground and then he throws it in front of him again, as we're all walking alongside him on our way to the teleporter room.\r\n\r\n\"It's just that you've been throwing that sword over and over for a few minutes now, and I was starting to get a bit worried about your mental state,\" Hadrik says. \"You know that you can ask one of us to hold your sword for a while if you're too tired to carry it, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not too tired to carry the sword,\" Daren says, as he picks up his weapon from the floor. \"I'm trying to use aura manipulation to make it fly back into my hand, like the king of the underground suggested. Why did you think I kept pointing my palm towards it every time after I threw it on the ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what you were trying to do?...\" Arraka says. \"I would have never guessed in a million years. I swear, your sheer level of ineptude when it comes to anything aura related is truly a sight to behold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, were you planning to say anything useful, or should I just ignore your mad ramblings and continue with what I'm doing?\" Daren says."

        text: "\"If you continue like that, the sun will die out before you make any meaningful progress,\" Arraka says. \"There's no use in expanding your aura if you don't know how to harden it. That 'king of whatever' already told you that this technique works best for items that you are familiar with, right? So instead of doing it manually, you should just try to focus on the sword's image in your head while you unleash the five flowing streams from your fingertips until you feel that they've made contact with the sword. It's as simple as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The five flowing streams from my fingertips?\" Daren says. \"What kind of nonsense is that? Do you just make this stuff up on the spot, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I don't have the patience to explain this like I'm speaking to some toddler again,\" Arraka says. \"Hey, goblin! You understood what I was talking about, right? You translate it to him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uhm... \" Kelrim says. \"I think she is referring to the tingly sensation that you get in your fingers every time when you begin to conceal your aura. If you try to remember that exact feeling and then imagine that it's coming from streams of water flowing through your fingertips, you could probably also imagine yourself 'unleashing' them like jets towards the sword on the ground. If remembering the tingly sensation is too hard, you could try to conceal your aura right now so that you get a good idea of what I'm talking about.\""

        text: "\"Hmm...\" Daren says, as we all stop moving to get a good look at what he's doing. \"I suppose it's worth a shot. Let's see...\"\r\n\r\nHe then throws his sword ahead of him again, but this time he no longer points his hand towards it. He just squints his eyes at his weapon, trying hard to focus. To all of our surprise, this time around the sword lifts itself from the ground immediately and it flies with its hilt directly into Daren's hand without him even needing to move his arm to catch it.\r\n\r\n\"That was it?!\" Daren says. \"That's all I had to do? What the hell? I thought I would need at least weeks of training for this! If it's this easy, then why doesn't everyone do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that easy, you dope,\" Arraka says. \"You obviously have a natural affinity for aura manipulation, or else you wouldn't have learned it so fast. If you were to ask some random mage to do the exact same thing you did just now, they would almost certainly fail. Hell, if you weren't such a blockhead when it comes to actually understanding the basics of how auras work, you might even become decently good at this.\""

            text: "\"Does this mean that Daren could perform better than the royal guard captain in the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would you ask that?\" Arraka says. \"Do you think the captain doesn't also have an affinity for aura manipulation, or what? He clearly wouldn't have gotten so good at it if he didn't have a talent for it himself. If you ask me, Daren will probably never reach the level of the captain or the underground king, because those two already got a thirty year headstart. And it's not like Daren will spend as much time as them trying to learn those techniques either. He would be better off learning simple techniques that are focused more on utility than on overpowering his opponents. For example, he could glue the sword to his hand with his aura when he fights, so that his enemies could no longer disarm him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do that with my aura?\" Daren says. \"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me think of a way to explain this in terms that are easy enough even for someone like you to understand,\" Arraka says. \"Let's see... How does the goblin usually translate these things into idiot language? Ah, yes! You already know what the five flowing streams from your fingertips are now, right? Well, instead of imagining them like jets of water, you should think of them as the rapidly drying liquid glue that certain species of giant snails leave as trails behind them. You remember that one time when Hadrik turned himself into a snail and then glued himself to the ground to fight that mammoth, don't you? Just try to imagine the aura flowing from your fingertips to be of a similar substance, and make it cover your sword while you are holding it.\""

You were almost certainly making him angry on purpose, in order to see if you could get his aura to fluctuate. So, I ask you again. What did you find out?\"\r\n\r\nArraka laughs.\r\n\r\n\"Still as perceptive as ever, I see,\" she says. \"Fine, I admit it. Melindra caught my interest when she mentioned his relatively stagnant aura earlier, and I wanted to see if he was just suppressing it or if it really was something that he was born with, like he said. It was pretty obvious that I managed to both piss him off and make him lie about his old nickname when I made fun of him, but I still couldn't see any changes in his aura whatsoever. This means that he was most likely telling the truth about his aura naturally being like this, because I would have certainly noticed if he were trying to keep it stable on purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he was not suppressing his aura on purpose because he had something to hide from us, then,\" Illuna says. \"That's good to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you two lower your voices a little more?\" Daren says. \"We don't want to give away our position before we even get to the first shop.\""

We should be safe for now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to say...\" Leila writes. \"I don't really like the way these shopkeepers are looking at us.\"\r\n\r\nNow that Leila mentions it, I realize that most of the shopkeepers we've passed so far have either been giving us accusatory looks through their windows, or they've been backing away in fear at the mere sight of us. It's pretty clear that we are not exactly welcome here.\r\n\r\n\"It is normal that they act this way,\" Kate says. \"The king said that nobody is allowed to walk these streets until his brother's murderers are found, so it shouldn't take a genius to realize that anyone who is willing to ignore the curfew and go out for a stroll at this hour can only be looking for trouble. Even if they haven't already heard our descriptions from the guards, they still have plenty of reasons to be wary of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of being wary...\" Hadrik says. \"Look who's coming down to greet us.\"\r\n\r\nAs we all look up at the sky, we see a green-eyed drone slowly making its way down towards us."

This feature prevents you from shutting down the drones or the protocol while they are in maintenance mode, even if you are the system administrator. It is a precaution that was taken in order to avoid causing unwanted damage to the Overseer protocol by accident. Through the activation of the maintenance mode, I was able to stop Biliborrathrathsarran from shutting down most of the key aspects of the Overseer protocol, although he was still able to turn off some minor routines that were incorporated into the Overseer's personality.\"\r\n\r\n\"He removed some minor routines, huh?\" Hadrik says. \"Like... which ones, for example?\"\r\n\r\n\"The routines that got removed were mostly the types that were unnecessary or purely optional,\" the Overseer says. \"Like the routine that made me want to prioritize the well-being of the citizens of Varathia. Or the routine that handled mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh...\" Hadrik says.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange,\" the Overseer says. \"Even though these routines were only optional, I feel like their removal has greatly helped in making it clearer for me what my immediate goals are. For instance, now that I have come in contact with you once more, all I can think about is finding ways to make you perish. Is this what humans call having a 'desire for vengeance'? Very peculiar indeed. I will make sure to study this phenomenon after I've managed to send you all to your graves.\""

He wants to become the king's most trusted man, so that he can eventually manipulate him into attacking and conquering the other kingdoms of Varathia. When we first came in here, he told me that it disgusts him how all these technologically advanced relics are being wasted on defending the city, when they could be used for so much more.\""

What do you know about their plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plans?\" Loyrang says. \"What plans? The king put the ambassador from Thilias in charge of all the strategies. That guy's a moron. The only thing that he actually organized is the order in which the guards are raiding the civilian houses. He has no real strategy for when we're supposed to fight you, and the captain can't even keep half of his current troops under control. In all likelihood, Gontrok is probably going to charge ahead like he always does, and the others will need to rush after him to back him up. Aside from this, it all depends on how well you'll match up against each individual royal guard. I mean, you already saw how well you handled yourselves against Gontrok and the captain, so I'm not exactly sure what you're expecting to accomplish.\""

Of course, this would mean that you'd need to trust the shopkeeper to not let me out of that room after you're gone, but it would have been the same even if you tied me up, since he could have easily cut the ropes and set me free if he wanted to.\""

Daren's transceivers are the only ones powerful enough to function properly through such a thick layer of seredium, and even they work inconsistently, as far as I've seen.\""

If at least one of these calls gets through, maybe we'll still have a chance to get out of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, I'd say we should be far enough now from where we were previously,\" Daren says, as we all stop moving. \"I'm trying to call him again.\"\r\n\r\nHe then taps his transceiver once more and puts it close to his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, can you hear us?!\" Daren shouts loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, we could really use your help right about now!\" Kelrim says."

I can't get a good lock on them with the teleporter, and they don't seem to hear me even if I've been trying to contact them for many minutes now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry, we can hear you now!\" Daren says. \"We moved to a different spot, and I think the signal might be better here.
