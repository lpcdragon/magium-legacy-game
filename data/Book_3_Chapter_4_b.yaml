I believe you should already know how to do that, given how you've managed to reach this room without alarming any of the guards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, we can open secret passages,\" I tell him. \"Where is this hidden door, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is this way,\" the Overseer says, as the green-eyed drone flies past us. \"Follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast, Overseer,\" Breynan says, and the metal ball stops in mid-air. \"What about the door that you just came from? What's over there?\"\r\n\r\n\"That way leads directly to the upper levels,\" the Overseer says. \"However, there are many guards patrolling the halls, and there is no way to avoid all of them without raising the alarm. The secret passage I was about to show you was built by the lessathi of old, just like the ones from the tunnels underneath Varathia, which means that nobody in this tower knows about them. You will be able to travel through the passage without encountering any resistance.\""

Once she confirms that we're all paying attention, she opens the secret door in the same way that she opened the last one, and then we exit the tunnel one by one, making our way into what appears to be some kind of workshop.\r\n\r\n\"Wh-wh-what are you doing here?...\" we hear the panicked voice of Billy Bob the lessathi, who is standing next to a table in the middle of the room that has a disassembled drone on top of it. \"Who are you people? Drones! Attack them right now! Kill them! Kill them!\"\r\n\r\nThere are six red-eyed drones hovering right above the lessathi, but they seem in no hurry to carry out his orders. Seeing that the drones are ignoring him, Billy Bob now addresses a green-eyed drone to his right.\r\n\r\n\"Overseer, what is the meaning of this?\" Billy Bob says."

It looks like there is nobody left in this workshop that could possibly take Billy Bob's side. He is completely defenseless. Now then... what should our next course of action be?\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, I see that Kate is preparing several icicles and that she is aiming them at Billy Bob, while giving him a look full of disgust.

You need to suppress your auras completely, like Illuna. Can you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so...\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try!\" Flower says.\r\n\r\n\"And the same goes for everyone else too,\" Melindra says. \"Try to keep your auras as suppressed as possible, and with a little luck, we might be able to walk past those guards unnoticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppress my aura,\" I say. \"Right.\"\r\n\r\nI try to conceal my aura as well as I can, using the breathing exercises that I learned from Illuna two weeks ago, but I only manage to partially hide it."

A few years ago, I was speaking to a hermit that everyone considered to be crazy, and he was always telling me how people are learning magic the wrong way, and how nobody would listen to him when he suggested that the magical academies should be completely restructured to follow his teachings. The main point of contention between him and the other scholars was his claim that imperfections in magical techniques are absolutely necessary if you want to create a perfect spell. The obvious contradiction in his statement made everyone dismiss him as a senile old man, but his theory was that the more a technique gets closer to perfection, the more predictable it will become, and the easier it would be to counteract it.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm seeing the perfect way in which these machines are executing their spells, I think I'm finally beginning to understand what that hermit meant. I can tell exactly what they're trying to do, and even if they're combining ten different spells at the same time, the way they are moving the flows of the auras is so 'by the book' that it would be impossible for me to not recognize every single one of them."

I continue to predict the rhythm of the drones' magic flow by using every piece of information I know about how their spells are supposed to be cast.

Off you go, come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's with all the commotion?...\" Breynan asks, as the rest of the people are getting ready to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\"You mean you don't know?\" the teleporter guy asks, shocked. \"Have you literally been living under a rock in these past few hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're all living under rocks, Barry,\" Breynan says. \"Our base is in an underground cavern. Tell me, what happened while we were gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"What DIDN'T happen?\" the teleporter guy says. \"The whole city is in lockdown mode. Nobody is allowed to leave, nobody is allowed to enter. People can't even leave their houses without being arrested by the guards! It's terrible! We're teleporting all of our agents back and some of their families. We have no idea what the king is going to do next. Everything is in complete chaos!\""

        text: "\"But why?\" Breynan asks. \"What could have possibly driven the king to take these rash actions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll tell you what!\" the teleporter guy says, as he mashes a few buttons and now a new group is being teleported inside the room. \"The king announced his reasons as soon as he initiated the lockdown. He said that his brother has been murdered in Thilias, and that his killers are hiding in this very city right now! That's the entire reason for this whole lockdown. So that the city guards can search every house and see if anyone is hiding the murderers!\"\r\n\r\n\"The king's brother was killed in Thilias?\" I ask, feigning ignorance. \"But... how did he find out about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really need to ask?\" the teleporter guy says. \"There is only one person who represents the king in Thilias and who would have been there to witness the events.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" the teleporter guy says. \"The ambassador from Thilias has returned.\""
