        text: "The girl dressed in pajamas is looking at us with a victorious smile on her face. She seems very pleased with herself for having managed to finally get our attention. Despite the fact that she is clearly the one who has magically suspended us into the air, her aura is showing no traces of magic whatsoever. Even when Kate and Flower hide their auras, you can still tell that they are mages if you inspect their auras very closely. The girl in front of us, however, seems no different from a regular human. This can mean one of two things. Either she is much better at hiding her aura than Flower and Kate, or...\r\n\r\n\"Hey, I know you!\" Arraka blurts out all of a sudden. \"You're that stillwater girl that kept trailing behind Eiden and the fox during the still winter! Uh... what was the name?... Melenda? Milandra?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Melindra,\" the stillwater girl says, in a cold voice, and then she flicks one of her fingers, casting a wind spell that closes Arraka's amulet.\r\n\r\nArraka mumbles furiously from within her amulet, but nobody is paying any attention to her. Having silenced the banshee, the stillwater girl regains her smile, and she attempts to continue her speech from where she left off."

The reason why I went to watch you in the arena was because I heard that you got convicted for killing a noble from Varathia, so I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a second, there...\" Hadrik interrupts her. \"You're a stillwater?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes...\" Melindra says, confused. \"I thought that much would have been obvious by now. Even Arraka said earlier that--\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you become one?\" Hadrik asks. \"Did you get born this way? Can women be born as stillwaters?\""

I became a stillwater in the same way that everyone else did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone?\" I ask. \"Even Eiden? Is Eiden an artificial mage too? Wasn't he born as a mage?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is an artificial mage?\" Melindra says, in a frustrated tone. \"Eiden was born as a mage. He just became a stillwater later, just like everyone else. How is this so difficult to understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" I ask her. \"How do you become a stillwater?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" Melindra says. \"If you think that I'm going to just stand here and answer every single one of your questions before you even listen to what I'm--\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know Eiden?\" Daren asks her. \"Are you working with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not working with Eiden!\" Melindra says, visibly upset. \"If I were working with Eiden, do you think I'd need to come and ask you for help? Why can't you just shut up for ten seconds and let me finish one damn senten--\""

After a few seconds of silence, the stillwater girl waves one of her hands, and we all slowly start to descend towards the ground.\r\n\r\nIt's funny. This girl may well have the power to crush us with a single flick of her fingers, but her demeanor makes her feel like one of the least threatening persons I've met in my life. Perhaps even less threatening than Flower, or the ambassador of Ollendor.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" Melindra says, once her levitation spell gets completely cancelled. \"You're all back on the ground. Now, can I continue from where I left off, or are you planning to interrupt me with even more questions?\""

How hard could it be to find them?\"\r\n\r\nMelindra smirks at Daren, and she takes what appears to be a pinecone seed out of her pocket. She then puts the seed in her hand, and it immediately starts to glow with a bright yellow light, just like Golmyck said it would when he announced our first objectives. She then holds her hand out to Daren, inviting him to take the pinecone seed from her."

They only resonate with auras that have an extremely high amount of magical power in them. If we're talking about contestants from the mage tournament, I doubt that anyone other than the four sages would have enough magical power for a pinecone to start glowing in their hands. You'd need pure blind luck to discover a glowing pinecone if you can't even make them glow when you touch them. If you don't believe me, you can pass that pinecone seed between yourselves.

I was lucky enough to find a few seeds on the ground near the border of a sacred forest, while I was on my way here. I wouldn't dare to venture any deeper into one of those forests in order to find an actual pinecone. The golden fox hates my guts!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" I say. \"Why a sacred forest?

I think this is the first time when she actually realizes that she won't need to part ways with us, now that the arena is over.\r\n\r\n\"You will be coming with us to Ollendor, right?\" I ask her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Leila writes, smiling happily. \"Yes, of course!\""

          to us, and that she won't back out of the deal after we've fulfilled
          our end of the bargain, but maybe there's something else we need to
          add, to make sure that the deal is made in good faith?"

This is a regular lessathi aura any way I look at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see...\" Leila writes, with a faint smile on her face. \"Thank you for your answer!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing her relieved smile, I suddenly remember the story she told me about the lessathi from her youth that treated her like some kind of reject because she was mute, and who were accusing her of being a half-lessathi, due to her disability. It seems that those people's slander had in fact affected her a lot more than she let on until now.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Melindra says, as she turns to the rest of us, \"I believe that we're done for the day! If nobody else has any objections, I would very much like it if we could begin our journey tomorrow, at the crack of dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually,\" Daren says, \"we still need to get some papers from the king, before we can leave the city. We'll be visiting him later today, but it's not guaranteed that he'll have them ready by the time we get there. Hold on!\""

It's been enchanted to cover very long distances, so we'll be able to contact you no matter where you are in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, then,\" Melindra says, as she puts the transceiver in one of her pockets. \"If nothing changes, then we'll meet at the city's northern gate, as soon as the sun rises.

That's why it's so hilarious to kill a spirit in the magical plane. On the earthen plane, most living beings will expect to die at some point, but the great majority of the spirits on the magical plane fancy themselves as immortals.  The desperation with which they cling to life in their final moments cannot be compared with that of any being on this plane of existence, which is what makes it all the more satisfying when you do them in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what did the gods have to say about all of this?\" I say. \"Didn't you say that they live on the magical plane too?

        text: "\"Did you...\" I say, but I pause for a few moments to rearrange my thoughts. \"Did you just imply that the reason why women cannot be born as mages on our earthen plane is directly related to your exile from the magical plane?\"\r\n\r\nAfter hearing my last sentence, Kate, who didn't seem to be paying very close attention to our conversation until now, has finally turned her head towards us, and she is now watching us intently.\r\n\r\n\"So you finally figured it out, eh, Barry-boy?\" Arraka says. \"What is it that tipped you off? Is it perhaps the fact that all of the banshees are practically humanoid female spirits? Or maybe the fact that female animals and monsters can still cast magic, while your women are completely unable to do it, unless their auras have been drastically altered? Oh... or maybe it's the fact that women only gain magic when they are possessed by banshees. That's a pretty big hint, if you ask me! Hell, you even had Flower as an example. Her element is fire, while Illuna's element is water. It's clear that she didn't just inherit the magic from Illuna, right? Didn't it ever occur to you that in order to channel that energy from the magical plane, you need to actually create a link with a magical spirit that is at least somewhat similar to you, in nature? You didn't seriously think that you could just pull that energy out on your own, without some magical spirit to act as a funnel for you, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" I say, \"what you are saying is that every one of the mages on the earthen plane is in fact linked with a spirit from the magical plane?\""
      - source: scene_text_2
        paragraph: 23
        text: "\"Well, yeah, but it's not like either of them is doing it consciously,\" Arraka says. \"Since they're on different planes of existence, the link does not need to be all close and personal. Most mages probably just link themselves to a spirit instinctively, and neither them, nor the spirits that they are linked to ever notice this for the rest of their lives. But you can't link yourself unconsciously with a spirit anymore if all of the spirits with similar auras to you are here, on the earthen plane instead. You can still try to cast magic through other means, sure, but then your aura would need to become something completely different. Like that of the stillwater girl, for example. Or that of your friend with the ice magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did these spirits manage to exile you to a completely different plane of existence?\" I say. \"Surely, it can't have been as simple as just throwing you out and locking the door behind you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the exile was Memphir's idea, from what I've heard,\" Arraka says. \"He always did have the talent to come up with crazily elaborate plans like these, even though only half of them usually worked out in his favor in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Memphir is the God of Fate, right?\" I say."

        text: "\"Yeah, the one with the illusions,\" Arraka says. \"I'm not sure how he came up with the idea, or how he managed to actually convince so many of the spirits to follow his plan, but what they basically did was to mess with the whole system that is in charge of assigning spirits to the magical plane, and they reprogrammed it in a way that assigns female spirits of the civilized races to the earthen plane instead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do that?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Well, obviously it's not easy,\" Arraka says. \"And you need a tremendous amount of energy to pull it off even if you figure out how to do it, but the bastards managed to rally enough of the spirits on their side to actually get the job done.\""

If I were to undo everything that Memphir and his crew did, I'd need to access the Magium directly, and I can't do that from the earthen plane.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Magium?...\" I ask her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not really the Magium,\" Arraka says. \"You get what I mean...\"\r\n\r\n\"No...\" I say. \"I don't, actually...\"\r\n\r\n\"You know...\" Arraka says. \"I'm talking about the part of the Magium that specifically deals with the creation of magical spirits and then sends them to the magical plane. You know how it works, right? Spirits aren't made to reproduce, even if they are split into males and females like you are here on the earthen plane. That's why there's this sort of... nest, or whatever you want to call it within the Magium that makes sure to pump out new spirits and to send them to the magical plane after the old ones die, in order to have roughly the same amount of spirits on the magical plane at any given time. Except these bastards managed to change the way it works! As soon as they were done tampering with the nest, it even sent the ones of us who were already there to the earthen plane, not to mention all the new ones that were created after that. And even from Varathia, the only parts of the Magium that I can access are the ones that I don't need!\""

Did you hear what he said? He asked how big the Magium is! Aha-AHAHAHAHA!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop laughing, damn it!\" I say, as I finally snap. \"Tell me what you know about the Magium!\""

You can't win a fight through raw power alone. You need to have some versatility. As a generalist, Azarius can use spells of many different types, which makes his attacks a lot more unpredictable. Specialists will always be at a disadvantage when fighting against generalists for this reason. That's why I tried my best to master both enchantment and white magic, during my lifetime. Limiting myself to only one specialization would have given me far less options when fighting against other trained mages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Hadrik says. \"It's not like Talmak can only cast earth magic. You've seen him at the last year's sage contest. He can cast lightning magic too. And a whole bunch of other spells!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Daren says. \"Basic spells. I never saw him cast any complex spells outside of his own specialization.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it matter if they're simple spells?\" Hadrik says. \"He can just use his huge energy to boost them and then they'll be just as strong as the more complex spells!\""

This is just you refusing to admit your mistakes. You failed. You had all the power in the world, but you still couldn't achieve what you wanted. And instead of manning up and trying to fix things, what do you do? You just sweep it all under the rug as if none of this was your fault, and then you decide to end everything by your own hand, as if that would somehow make it better. Stop this, already. You are only making a fool of yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard just about enough of this,\" Eiden says, in a dismissive tone. \"You speak without even knowing the situation in which the other cities are in.

The levels to which some of these people have stooped are much lower than what you could ever imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what?\" I say. \"Aren't you their leader? Isn't it the leader's job to make sure that his people don't go on the wrong path? How did you even manage to let it come to this?

You, on the other hand had all the power you needed, but all you managed to do was make things worse. What was the deal with Olmnar, anyway?

It's because of the warning message, isn't it? I also had access to that same time freezing spell back when you powered up my stat device, so I still remember how it works! You're not allowed to move more than a few feet from your original position, so if any part of your body goes over a certain boundary, you're going to get a warning message, telling you that if you don't retreat in the next ten seconds, your spell will get cancelled.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what makes you think that triggering this warning helps me in any way?\" Eiden asks me.\r\n\r\n\"It helps you,\" I say, \"because whoever designed that spell never bothered to take the actual warnings into account when calculating the duration! As long as you don't go too far beyond the boundary, and you retreat at the very end of the ten second countdown, you can practically add ten more seconds to the duration of the spell every time you do this. And since the time limit of the spell has been added by design, due to safety reasons, and not due to technical limitations, you could probably lengthen the duration of this spell almost indefinitely, if you're confident enough that you can keep it under control. So, that's what Arraka and Tyrath had been talking about all this time, when they said that you were using tricks. It's not that you don't need to obey the laws of magic because you're too powerful. You're just taking advantage of technicalities to get around the rules, and you make it seem as if it was thanks to your power all along. You're using loopholes!\""

Leaving aside the fact that I've had hundreds of years to learn these technicalities, even if you managed to learn them all, my level of magical power still dwarfs that of most beings on this island, with very few exceptions. I would say that you are not in a better situation now, than you were when you first met me on the second day of the tournament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" I say. \"Because now I know that you're not invincible. If you needed to learn all these tricks, then it means that your power alone was not enough to help you win all of your battles. It means that you have weaknesses. And if you have weaknesses, you can be defeated.\""

And here I was, thinking that I wouldn't have anything interesting to do until the end of this tournament.\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses.\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" Eiden says. \"In that case, I'll be looking forward to your progress. And I will also be monitoring your activity within the cities, as I said earlier. Now then, would you happen to have any more questions, before I take my leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one,\" I say. \"What is the Magium?\"\r\n\r\nEiden grins.\r\n\r\n\"You weren't seriously expecting to get an answer to that question so easily, were you?\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I say, \"but it was worth a shot.\""

As soon as he disappears, the time freezing spell gets cancelled, and my friends begin to look around them confused, trying to figure out where Eiden went.\r\n\r\n\"So, Eiden is gone...\" Daren says, after a while. \"And Barry is the only one that doesn't seem surprised by this sudden turn of events. Is there anything that you might want to tell us, Barry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Daren...\" I say. \"I'm certain that you have many questions, and I'll be sure to answer them in a bit, but first I'm going to need you to do something for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" Daren asks.\r\n\r\n\"Pull out a pen and paper from your backpack,\" I say, \"and write all of the protection spells that you had cast on yourself on our second day in Varathia. We've got work to do.\""
