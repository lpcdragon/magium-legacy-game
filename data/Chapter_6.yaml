        text: "\"Alright, I think that's a wrap!\" says Daren once we finish our strategy meeting. \r\n\r\nWe're currently all sitting in a circle in front of our cave's entrance. The sun is pretty high up in the sky, and there's not a cloud in sight. Luckily, Kate has graciously agreed to use her ice magic to cool the air around us a bit. This way we can enjoy the weather without feeling as if we were inside an oven. \r\n\r\n\"Noon is almost upon us,\" Daren continues. \"We should get going as soon as possible. We can't afford to keep travelling once the sun sets, and we have a long road ahead of us. Rose, did you get all of the herbs you were looking for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no... I just remembered, I dropped my bag of herbs when I was being chased by the goblins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, I doubt anyone would have stolen it, so it must still be where you left it. I'll help you look for it! Come with me.\"\r\n\r\nI get up to follow them, but Kate grabs me by the sleeve."

Thanks a lot, Daren. What am I supposed to tell her, now?"

Our last reserves of food were dwindling and it wasn't long before only the rich had access to any kind of conjured food that remained. Animal hunting became more and more popular, and a war between the animals and the humans was inevitable. The war has cost us many lives, including Molan's father. Ever since he died, I couldn't bring myself to look either of them in the eyes again. That's why I haven't visited them for so long.\""

        text: "\"Hey, I've been meaning to ask, did something happen between you and Elaria?\"\r\n\r\nMy question took Rose by surprise. She must have realized she wasn't acting like herself, because she tried to feign her usual smile. She didn't really pull it off very well, because even though her mouth was smiling, her eyes were still showing sadness.\r\n\r\n\"It was that obvious, huh? Yes, something happened, although it wasn't something that Elaria or I did. A few months ago, after the death of our grand priest, people started to get desperate. Our last reserves of food were dwindling and it wasn't long before only the rich had access to any kind of conjured food that remained. Animal hunting became more and more popular, and a war between the animals and the humans was inevitable. The war has cost us many lives, including Molan's father. Ever since he died, I couldn't bring myself to look either of them in the eyes again. That's why I haven't visited them for so long.\""

But at least I got you to laugh, so it can't have been all that bad, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you were the worst,\" Rose says, smiling. \"Come on, we're lagging behind. Let's catch up with Daren.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after we begin our trip, Daren notices that I've strapped my crossbow to the back of my backpack.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, why aren't you just putting that crossbow inside the backpack, like you did with everything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, because it's already full with all my other stuff.\""

She is now studying Daren closely.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Barry,\" Daren says. \"Do you want to have your backpack extra secure or should I just leave it like this? If I secure it, then only you will be able to take items out of it. The only downside is that you can't really authorize other persons to take items from your backpack once you secure it.

During our conversations, Daren was of course the one that's been speaking the most, while Kate has been as evasive as always about her past and her reasons for being here. Hearing our stories, Rose decides to join our discussion, by telling us a bit about herself.\r\n\r\n\"I've always liked plants,\" she tells us. \"Plants and books. So it's no surprise that I spent most of my youth with my nose buried in herbology manuals. As time passed, I started to learn more about herbal medicine, and I realized my talents could be used to help the people in need. Most people I help don't really have much money to repay me, but the little they give me is enough for me to make a living, and their sincere feelings of gratitude are much more rewarding to me than the money I'd get by only working for rich folk. I've been living a modest life along with my brother and sister who are nine and eight years old respectively, and ever since my father died last year, I've been occasionally getting some financial support from my ex husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were married?\" Daren asks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for a few years, but it didn't really work out in the end. We've both moved on with our lives since then, and we've had no children together, so there were no hard feelings. Ever since my father died, I've had to take care of my siblings all by myself, so my main focus for the past year has been my work, and my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about your mother?\" says Kate."

By planting your seeds further away from the town, you run a great risk of getting your crops raided by monsters.\""

It's not just in our area, it happens throughout the entire continent. I'm not certain, but I think it all started when we lost contact with the animal kingdom. After the first animal hunts were started by the people of Olmnar several decades ago, the animals' leader, the spirit golden fox has ordered her subjects to stop speaking in our language. The monsters must have found out about this, and they took advantage of the fact that the humans and the animals were no longer working together in order to wreak havoc.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the gods?\" Daren asks. \"Are they not getting involved in any of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only gods that are currently getting involved are the god of Fate and the god of Death, but I very much doubt that any of them have our best interests at heart. It is said that the two of them started working together recently, and that might well be true, judging by the high level of cooperation between their followers lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, isn't the god of Fate just a fancy title for the god of Illusions?\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Rose answers. \"Most gods name themselves after the power their followers gain by worshipping them. Some of them, however choose other names for themselves, which can be a bit confusing. It's the same for the god of Death. Judging by his name, you would think that he reigns over the underworld, but in fact he is just a god of Necromancy, bringing the dead back to life to serve his bidding.\""

It's true that there are some mages that actually use their magic to augment their powers, in a similar way that this device does. Does that make me one of them?\r\n\r\n\"I suppose...\" I answer her. \"But it's only temporary. The device will run out of energy once I'm no longer surrounded by all these powerful mages to extract it from.\"\r\n\r\nI take a look at my stat booster and start to think of what I should spend my newly acquired points on."

        text: "As I finish using my device, Rose asks me another question.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, so if your stat booster extracts magical energy from other mages, does that mean it's also eating away at Daren and Kate's powers?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's getting a bit of energy from every mage in a thirty mile radius, but the amount it takes from each of them is barely enough to mildly inconvenience them. Most of the energy it's getting is from the powerful spells that have been cast all around us since the beginning of this tournament, and that energy would have just dissipated into thin air anyway, so you could just say I'm recycling it, rather than stealing it. I think that--\"\r\n\r\nI get interrupted by a very loud roar that echoes all around us. \r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" Rose asks, visibly scared.\r\n\r\nA second, louder roar now booms through the air, as I can feel my hair stand up on the back of my neck. I've never heard this sound before in my life. I have no idea what beast might be causing it. So then what is this feeling of dread I'm getting all of a sudden? Why do I find myself wanting to run as fast as I can, in any direction, as long as it gets me as far away from this place as possible?"

        text: "Shortly after the second roar ended, a very powerful wind started to blow towards us. I can almost feel it trying to lift me in the air. The trees are barely holding up, and it looks as if they could get pulled out of their roots at any moment. We're lucky that this happened while we were in a clearing, because otherwise we would have had to also protect ourselves from falling trees, while trying to hold our ground against the relentless force of the wind.\r\n\r\nAs some of the trees start to fall, a monstrous figure makes its appearance high above us. It's at least fifty foot tall, with very tough looking red scales covering its entire body, and wings the size of sails on a longship. Its claws look as sharp as blades, and its fangs are bared at us menacingly, but its overall appearance is not much different from that of an overgrown lizard. \r\n\r\nA dragon. They really existed. Is this all happening because of my disappointment for not encountering any mythical creatures so far? If that's the case, then I take it back. I take it all back, just, please, let this all be a dream. Let this all just be the end of a bad dream, before I wake up back in our cave, and then we can start our journey anew. \r\n\r\n\"Get down!!!\" Daren shouts to us, as the dragon gets closer, and then lands a few dozen feet in front of us, making the whole ground tremble violently under its weight. \r\n\r\n\"No...\" Rose says, unable to control her shivering, and barely able to keep her balance anymore. \"This can't be happening. This can't be happening...\""

Once he sees the slide finished, Daren furiously thrusts his sword into the dragon's claw, as it starts to scream in pain and drops him right on the slide that's been custom made for him. \r\n\r\nJust as Daren finishes sliding down, the dragon uses his fire breath again, this time aiming directly for Kate. She makes a large thick shield of ice float above her in order to provide her cover. As the flames and the ice clash, I can see that Kate is making a great effort to keep the fire back. \r\n\r\nDaren quickly rushes to her position and provides her with cover before her ice melts away. Unfortunately, the fight has weakened him as well, and he does not manage to hold the barrier for long.

Once he sees the slide finished, Daren furiously thrusts his sword into the dragon's claw, as it starts to scream in pain and drops him right on the slide that's been custom made for him. \r\n\r\nCasting so many spells one after the other has taken its toll on Kate, who still hadn't recovered fully after this morning's skirmish with the crossbowmen. She is breathing heavily, and her right hand is trembling.\r\n\r\nJust as Daren finishes sliding down, the dragon uses his fire breath again, this time aiming directly for Kate. She makes a large thick shield of ice float above her in order to provide her cover.\r\n\r\nAs the flames and the ice clash, I can see Kate struggling to keep her shield intact, but it is too much for her, in her current state. The shield melts, and the flames engulf her entire left arm and half of her face. She starts to scream from the pain, but quickly stops herself, and uses ice to put out the fire. The flames have left a hideous red mark covering the whole left side of her face, but her resolve has not wavered. She looks more determined than ever.\r\n\r\nShe readies a new ice shield and prepares to block the dragon's next breath attack."

        text: "As Eiden vanishes completely, time is slowly starting to resume its course. I take the stillwater's advice and quickly conjure a protective barrier around Kate and Daren. It's amazing how natural this is feeling. It's as if I've been casting spells my entire life. Is this really the true power of my stat device?\r\n\r\nJust as I finish casting my spell, time unfreezes itself and the dragon's fire hits my magical barrier head on. The flames then  disperse into the air, while Kate looks around her, shocked at the discovery of the newly formed barrier protecting her.\r\n\r\n\"Daren, did you...\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wasn't me. This barrier is leagues stronger than anything I could ever conjure. I don't know who did this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" the dragon Tyrath shouts from high above in the sky, while pointing at me. \"You did this! It does not matter. All you've managed to achieve is to make yourself my next target. Prepare to die!\""

        text: "I conjure another protective barrier around me and Rose just in time to defend us from the incoming flames. My barrier is holding up much better than Daren's. There's no sign of it breaking any time soon, and I'm barely even feeling the heat outside of it. \r\n\r\nThe question is, what am I going to do now? Looking at my device, I can see that my stats have remained exactly the same and I have no extra available points, so then what did Eiden do to it? I'll need to figure this out later. \r\n\r\nAt any rate, judging by the amount of extra energy I can sense in the stat device and the speed at which it's getting consumed, I'd say that the estimate Eiden gave me is spot on. I have less than five minutes to finish this fight, but even with all this magical power, the dragon may well pulverize me in a one on one fight if I don't do this right. Both Daren and Kate are too exhausted to assist me, so I'm on my own for the time being.  Even as I'm standing here thinking, time is running out, but can I afford to just start fighting without any plan whatsoever?"

First things first, I need to get out of this barrier without getting burnt to a crisp. \r\n\r\nI cast a spell to protect myself from fire, and then a spell that enables flight. I fly out of the barrier, and right through the scorching flames. It feels as if I were in an oven, but at least I'm not getting any visible burns. The dragon sees me fly through his fire and lets out an intimidating roar.  I position myself at the same level of height as him, a few dozen feet from where he's hovering and I stop in mid-air.\r\n\r\nLet's try acid first. I make a ball of acid and send it flying towards the dragon. Tyrath claps his wings together, which generates a strong gust of wind that scatters the acid, and sends me spinning backwards. That disoriented me a bit, so it took me a few seconds to figure out where the dragon went. Once I locate him, I send a powerful jet of water in his direction. The dragon gets pushed back by the force of the impact, but aside from that, it does not look like he took any damage."

        text: "Going in without a plan would be suicidal. I'll just have to use this time as efficiently as I can. First of all, I need to think about my defenses. I now have access to dozens of powerful protection spells, but it would take me three minutes to cast all of them. \r\n\r\nEven if I use the time freezing spell Eiden cast just now, that would still only save me about two minutes, and I'll become unable to use the spell for the remainder of the battle. Then again, the time stopping spell isn't really suited for combat, since the spell breaks as soon as I move a few feet or interact with anyone who's frozen, so this may well be the best time to use it. Or maybe I should try to limit casting to only what is absolutely necessary?\r\n\r\nLet's see... The one thing I'll need the most is protection from fire. I can't just spend my whole fight trapped inside this barrier, and this spell will grant me some immunity from flames. It'll still feel like I'm in an oven, but at least I won't be burnt to a crisp. \r\n\r\nAside from that, judging by how I've seen the dragon fight so far, I think I could also use some protection from physical damage, to defend me from his claw attacks. It won't be enough to stop him from killing me if he lands a strike, but maybe it'll help me deflect some of his hits."

It is said that some of the older dragons can cast magic, but I do not know if Tyrath is one of them. More than that, I have no way of knowing which kind of magic he'd be specialized in.\r\n\r\nI'm going to have to decide which protection spells I cast in the limited time I have at my disposal."

My barrier is too strong to be broken as easily as Daren's though, so he'll be busy for a while.\r\n\r\nNow that I've established my defensive strategy, I need to think about the offensive. With the spells I have access to now, I have almost limitless choices, but I'll have to think of a tactic that can defeat Tyrath in the few minutes I have left.\r\n\r\nI'm going to definitely need to cast a flight spell on myself, since it will be too difficult to engage the dragon otherwise. \r\n\r\nThe thing I'm lacking the most here is information about my enemy. All I have to go on are legends and fairy tales, and I'm not sure how much I can rely on any of them in this situation. One thing that most legends agree on is that dragons have a high elemental resistance to fire and that they are immune to mind affecting spells and illusions. Other than that, I have no idea which spells would work best.\r\n\r\nI already know that Kate's ice didn't really hurt the dragon, but maybe water would be a better choice? Water is after all the opposing element to fire. Actually, forget water, if I am to try elemental magic I may as well try them all, except fire of course.\r\n\r\nDaren's sword seemed to at least be able to get through the dragon's tough scales but I do not know what enchantments he has on it. Maybe I could persuade him to give me his sword for the duration of this battle, and then I can fight Tyrath head on? The downside to this plan is that I don't seem to have a strength enhancing spell in my repertoire, so the power of my swing would depend entirely on my strength stat."

        paragraph: 43
        text: "Shapeshifting magic is pretty useless in this situation, because of two main reasons. First of all, these spells cannot be used to transform into something much bigger than my actual size, so it's not like I can just turn into a dragon and fight Tyrath on equal footing. Secondly, you cannot cast spells while shapeshifted, so my mobility would be greatly reduced because I couldn't teleport. It's just not worth it any way I look at it.\r\n\r\nUsing summoning magic is out of the question as well, since none of these spells were designed to fight an enemy of this caliber. The most any of the summoned creatures could do is moderately inconvenience Tyrath or provide a distraction.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm thinking in too small of a scale, though. With the powers I have at my disposal right now, I could be doing a lot more damage. I could literally make a tornado out of thin air, or use earth magic to animate a rock giant that would dwarf the dragon and who could smash him between its hands. I could also make a blizzard, a lightning storm, a rain of acid and even a rain of meteorites. \r\n\r\nThe problem with all of these big spells is that it's almost impossible to prevent collateral damage, so I'd be forced to cast a lot of protections on Daren, Kate, Rose and even myself  beforehand to make sure we're all safe, which would take me about a minute. The time freezing spell wouldn't save me much time in this case, since we're relatively far apart from each other, and moving would cancel the time stopping effect.\r\n\r\nHalf a minute of my time is already up. I'll need to decide fast."

Suddenly, the dragon in front of me disappears and a different dragon appears behind me.\r\n\r\nTyrath whips his tail towards me and attempts to grab me with it. There was no time for me to dodge the hit, so I instinctively cast the time freezing spell that Eiden used earlier, stopping his tail a few inches before reaching me. My heart is beating like crazy. What is this? What just happened? Was that an illusion?\r\n\r\nDamn it! I completely let my guard down. I won't be able to cast the time freezing spell again until the end of the battle, so I'd better make the most of this. \r\n\r\nI cast a spell that allows me to see through illusions, as well as a spell to protect me from wind, and another one to protect me from physical damage. This should be enough for now. \r\n\r\nI use my sword to slash at the dragon's tail, which immediately unfreezes time, and the dragon screams in pain as I draw blood with my blade. He then teleports back twenty feet and shouts to me."

Damn it, there's so many big spells I could cast right now, but almost all of them would endanger Kate, Daren, Rose and even myself. I'd have to get back to the others and cast some protection spells before I start shooting tornados out of my fingertips. If I do it now, I might still have time to finish this fight before my five minutes are up."

What kind of crazy enchantments are on this thing anyway? Does this mean I can actually now use the dragon's flames as my own?\r\n\r\nI slash my sword towards the dragon, which sends all of his flames back towards him, concentrated in one powerful beam.\r\n\r\nIt worked! I can't believe it! Let me try and see if it can also absorb other magical elements. I concentrate my magical power on the sword in the form of lightning. I can feel the sword charge up and as I finish my spell, I can actually see the electrical current surging through it."

I feel exactly the same as before. I think he was mistaken. I can't have time powers. His spell must have just malfunctioned, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmm... Perhaps you're right,\" Daren says. \"At any rate, we should be thankful enough that we somehow managed to make it out of this alive. I've heard stories about how dangerous this place was, but I never imagined it would be as bad as this. We're all in terrible shape. Here, let me start casting some healing spells.\"\r\n\r\nDaren proceeds to heal us all in turn. When he starts healing Kate, I can clearly see that he's having some difficulty."

Your wounds were just too deep to heal completely.\"\r\n\r\nLooking at Kate, I can see that Daren has healed most of the damage made by the dragon's fire, but the left side of her face is still lightly scarred. Surprisingly, it does not look bad on her. Kate, after all, never really had a very feminine look to begin with. Her beauty was always more feral in nature, and her newly acquired scars complement it nicely. \r\n\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Kate tells Daren while looking at her face through a mirror made of ice. \"Most people were already calling me a monster and running away when they first saw me. At least now they'll have a legitimate reason for it.\""

As far as I know, transferring powers between mages is impossible without some kind of tool to assist them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he used my stat device. I'm not sure exactly what he did, but he made it start glowing, and then I suddenly got all of those spells. I've tried playing around with the stat booster ever since, in order to see if I could unlock some secret options or something, but I couldn't figure out how he did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, you're saying you got all of those powers through your stat device? No, that's impossible! In order for that to work, you'd need to have even less magical power than a human, otherwise it wouldn't match at all with the magical frequency of the device.\"\r\n\r\nShe pauses.\r\n\r\n\"Actually, come to think of it, your magical aura was always weaker than that of a normal human.
