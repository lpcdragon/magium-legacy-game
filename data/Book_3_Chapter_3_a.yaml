Two guards are currently standing on each side of the throne, while Albert and Peter are leaning against the wall on our left. The rest of us are all seated in the chairs that are facing the king, including Leila's father and Breynan, who were also invited to the meeting, along with us. \r\n\r\n\"Now, then...\" the king of the underground says, as he gets a serious expression in his eyes. \"I believe we should get straight to the point. When I was told of your group, I wasn't aware that the stillwater girl was in your team, but now that I know she's with you, everything makes much more sense. Am I correct in assuming that you all came here to kill the king of Ollendor?\"\r\n\r\n\"We did...\" Melindra says. \"But I don't remember ever meeting you. How do you know who I am?\""

Luckily for me, you are still wearing the same type of clothes, so it was easy for me to recognize you even after having been given such a vague description.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" Melindra says. \"I'll have you know that these clothes are in no way similar to what you people wear as pajamas! Tell me... what pajamas have you ever seen with such an elegant design and high quality fabric? Do you have any idea how long it took me to find someone capable of custom tailoring these clothes for me? Six hundred years ago, the only people who didn't wear these types of garments were servants and prisoners, but nowadays people can't even tell that they are not meant to be sleepwear. It's outrageous!\"\r\n\r\n\"My apologies!\" the king of the underground says. \"I did not mean to insult your clothing. I was simply repeating what my men have told me. I imagine that most clothes would start to feel uncomfortable, once you've gotten used to wearing only garments made of such fine silk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Melindra says. \"That is exactly why I can't bring myself to wear any other types of clothes. Finally, someone gets it!\""

And didn't you also say that one of those prototypes was so bad that its propeller stopped in mid-air, and you were forced to glide your way down to safety?

For example, there was this one time when I went to some ruins with an archaeology professor and we almost got buried alive when we accidentally triggered one of the traps. And I've also worked as an apprentice to quite a few mages, who were all very surprised at my ridiculously advanced knowledge of theoretical magic gained from my years of relentless study, and they wanted me to help them develop new spells. I think I've lost count of how many of those experimental spells ended up exploding in my face. Then there was that time when I was accompanying a relic hunter into an old cave, and we somehow ended up getting chased by a group of goblins. Man, that was a close one. To this day, I'm still not sure how we were able to make it out of there in one piece.\"\r\n\r\nLeila giggles silently.\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe that you were actually claiming to have been an 'everyday ordinary guy' before coming to Varathia,\" she writes. \"How is what you've described to me just now supposed to be anything close to 'ordinary'?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not?\" I ask her, surprised. \"But why wouldn't it be? I mean sure, all this stuff may sound dangerous when I talk about it, but I'm certain that even the most ordinary of people would be open to taking a few risks like these, if it meant getting one step closer to achieving their lifelong dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Barry, I think that's just you,\" Leila writes, with a smile. \"But thank you for telling me all of this.

He is also a generalist, and he is rather skilled, but no matter how many times he's reached the final round of the yearly sage tournaments, he has never once been able to get even close to beating Azarius. Ironically, the two of them are pretty good friends from what I've heard, although I've never seen them interacting with each other during the brief period of time in which I was serving as Brinhorn's apprentice. Anyway, the event I was talking about happened one day when the old mage came to me, saying that he had found a way to solve both our problems. He was claiming that he had found out about an artifact powerful enough to both turn me into a mage and to give him the power to defeat Azarius. Oh, how wrong he was...\"\r\n\r\n\"I take it that the artifact wasn't helpful, then?\" Leila writes."

It was all a trap, set up by some of Brinhorn's rivals from the sage tournament, who were upset that they could never reach the final round because of him, and who had decided to rid themselves of him before the contest even began, so they could finally get to challenge Azarius themselves. Man, that was a day to remember... We were basically trapped in a maze full of magical traps for hours on end, with barely any hopes of making it out of there alive. I practically had to use all of my knowledge about how the different types of magic work together in order to get us out of there in one piece. Luckily for me, Brinhorn was a generalist who could practically cast most types of spells in existence, so all I had to do was steer him in the right direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steer him in the right direction?\" Leila writes, with her eyes wide open, as her father has also temporarily stopped from his work to take a good long look at me. \"You?...

Hell, some of those books that I read were never even published. They were written by random mage hermits that nobody would take seriously, and who were so happy that someone was finally willing to listen to their theories that they let me read their whole manuscripts for free, just so they could have a lengthy talk with me about their writing afterwards. My notebook is filled with this type of knowledge that I've amassed during my travels. None of it managed to help me in any way to become a mage, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh...\" Leila writes. \"So, you were about to tell us how you escaped from the maze?...\""

        text: "\"Right, right, of course...\" I say. \"Where was I again? Oh yeah, I was talking about Brinhorn. You see, the thing about Brinhorn is that he had an amazing array of spells at his disposal, but he only knew the very basic applications for each of them. That's probably also the reason why he could never compete with Azarius. Just knowing how to cast the spells is not good enough. The main advantage you get by being a generalist is the flexibility. You can't just cast spells randomly as if you were a specialist and call it a day. Someone who specializes in a certain type of magic will always be better at it than you, on an individual level, but if you combine several types of magic together, the potential is limitless. The more spells you know, the more combinations are available to you, and as long as you know exactly how each individual spell interacts with all the others and how you need to cast them, you can become virtually unbeatable. Given how many spells Brinhorn had in his repertoire, there were countless ways in which he could have dealt with the traps, but since I wasn't exactly sure how much control he had over his own spells, I decided to go with the simplest idea that came to my head, so I told him to try and use multi-step dispelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Multi... what?...\" Leila writes."
      - source: scene_text_2
        paragraph: 12
        text: "\"Multi-step dispelling,\" I tell her again. \"It's a technique that I kind of made up myself, based on information that I gained from reading some older books and from talking with some of the hermit mages that I mentioned earlier. For some reason, nobody else thought of this before, but as long as you can tell exactly what spells were used to create a more complex spell, you can reverse-cast those exact spells against it, in order to cancel its effects. Obviously, this technique won't work all that well against a skilled mage like Azarius, because he'd be able to just change his spells on the fly, in order to confuse you, but if you're dealing with a magical trap, you have all the time you need to figure out which spells you need to cast and in which order. What's more, this technique is really low-risk when you use it against traps, because even if you fail, you won't trigger the trap by accident, so you can pretty much try it again and again, until you get the timing right. We had to spend the whole day in that maze until Brinhorn learned to reliably use the technique, but thankfully his rivals weren't waiting to ambush us outside, so we made it home safely afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a moment...\" Leila writes, seemingly in a slight state of shock. \"You're telling me that you're actually the one who invented the 'Brinhorn dispelling technique'? The technique that completely revolutionized dispelling magic all around the world a few years ago and that got included in most modern mage manuals to date?\""

You just need to do everything in reverse. The incantation, the movements, the manipulation of the aura flow... I mean it's not like the idea itself is all that revolutionary. The really difficult part is in the execution. You have no idea how many tries it took Brinhorn until he could finally get the timing and the motions right. And even if we theoretically knew how the technique worked, it still took hours of me and Brinhorn racking our brains together, trying to figure out the multitude of spells that had been used to set up some of those magical traps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but still...\" Leila writes. \"Did it seriously not cross Brinhorn's mind that he should at least credit you for your own technique?...\""

          honest, the annoying part for me wasn't the lack of credit, but the
          fact that after that whole episode with the maze, Brinhorn kept
          insisting that he wanted to introduce me to these scholars he knew, so
          that we could research magic on a theoretical level together. By that

          rumor about some new artifact, I left the town in which Brinhorn
          resided, and I haven't heard from him since. Then again, I can't say
          that I would be too surprised if I ran into him right here in Varathia
          one of these days. He did seem like the type who would join a
          tournament like this, after all."

The most I can do is figure out the stuff that he already used in front of us, but in order to find new loopholes, I would need a much more intuitive understanding of how magic works. This brings me to another important thing I wanted to ask of you, doctor Reidzek. Do you know if it would be possible for you to also unlock the magical stats from the stat device, along with the hidden aura stats?\"\r\n\r\n\"If by magical stats you are referring to the Magical Knowledge and Magical Power stats, then I'm afraid the answer is no,\" Leila's father says. \"The aura stats were only hidden, but the magical stats were locked for a reason, and unless you know the right code, you will never be able to unlock them. If you try to forcefully unlock these stats without the code, you could risk permanently damaging your device. I wouldn't recommend it.\""

The magical stats were probably first created in the hopes that they would work for regular lessathi. Half-lessathi were never really seen as equal to pure-blood lessathi, so the locking of the magical stats was almost certainly put in place in order to make sure that a half-lessathi would never get access to these stats by accident. On the other hand, the aura stats were hidden as a safety precaution, because they were still in an experimental state when the lessathi stopped working on these devices, and they never got to finish all the tests. That being said, from what I could gather, the three stats seemed for the most part functional, so you shouldn't worry too much about them failing on you in a crucial moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right...\" I say, in a not entirely convinced tone."

Unfortunately, we only have listening devices in the more desolate areas of the castle, because we didn't want to risk any of our men getting caught while they were planting them. As a result, we only very rarely get to hear any actual conversations, but when we do, we make sure to record them with the aid of all the machinery present in this room--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you confirm that this is the area where you would like to have the conversation?\" I suddenly hear the metallic voice of a 'droon', coming from one of the large metal devices in our room.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I then hear Eiden's voice, coming from the same device. \"Over here, in this empty corner would be perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Request acknowledged,\" the metal ball says. \"Please stand by.

First there was the living quarters, where people had their own private rooms in which they could sleep at night. Then, there was the mess hall, where the rebels and the king's men would go to eat their food. They also had an infirmary, and apparently a recreation area as well.

Apparently, Flower is still trying to imitate Kate's voice and demeanor, thinking that this would somehow make her sound more mature, and Illuna is getting increasingly more irritated by her behavior. When they noticed me, they stopped their fighting in order to greet me, but I'm willing to bet that they got right back into it as soon as I was out of earshot.\r\n\r\nWhile exploring the base, I had to go back to the waiting room several times, since it was situated right in the center of all the major sectors. At one point when I was in the waiting room, I ran into Daren and Arraka, who were apparently on their way to get some healing devices from the infirmary. When we saw each other, we stopped briefly so we could have a short chat about what we've been doing in the past few hours."

              out of his way lately to provide your group with information
              related to the king of Ollendor and his clique. I noticed this for

              a little suspicious. However, the confirmation came a few hours

              recording room exactly when Eiden was having a conversation with
              the Overseer, and Eiden more or less admitted that he lured the
              metal ball there on purpose because he knew that one of our
              listening devices was planted nearby. So, now I ask you again...

When I ask him what this is about, he says that he isn't allowed to talk about it, but I can easily tell that he's acting a lot more stressed out than the last time I spoke to him.

Just like the last time, Albert is also present in the room, leaning against a wall with his arms crossed, but Peter seems to be a lot more fidgety, and not so sure of himself anymore. It would appear that the only people from the last meeting who are missing this time around are Breynan and Leila's father.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for coming here on such short notice,\" the king of the underground tells us, as he sits on the throne in front of us. \"I know that you are all busy people, so I'm going to try and keep this brief.

              out of his way lately to provide your group with information
              related to the king of Ollendor and his clique. I noticed this for

              give the go-ahead shortly after your group arrived in the
              Perellion plaza. Since this was one of the few places where the
              screening of the ceremony was scheduled to take place, it made me
              a little suspicious. However, the confirmation came a few hours
              ago, when I received word that your friends happened to be in our
              recording room exactly when Eiden was having a conversation with
              the Overseer, and Eiden more or less admitted that he lured the
              metal ball there on purpose because he knew that one of our
              listening devices was planted nearby. So, now I ask you again...
              What exactly is your affiliation with Eiden?"
