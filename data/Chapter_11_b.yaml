        text: "\"How did you know we'd be here?\" Kate asks them.\r\n\r\n\"It's all thanks to your friend over there,\" the green robed mage says, as he points towards Rose. \"Some beggar overheard her telling a nurse in the hospital that she'd be bringing a skilled healer to tend to the sick. He sold us the tip for a reasonable sum, and we arranged the emptying of the streets together with the local guards, in case the healer in question was indeed the one we were looking for. Now then, Zack, you should just stand aside while I deal with these weaklings. I alone should be more than enough to finish them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you're not,\" Daren says. \"We already know that your god specializes in illusions. Illusions are useless against enemies who already expect them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure about that, healer?\" the green robed mage says, and all of a sudden, hundreds of clones of both him and his ally fill the entire marketplace area around us.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't moved from your original position, genius,\" Daren says, as he dashes towards him. \"I know which one is the real you.\"\r\n\r\nAs Daren reaches the two original mages, he slashes his sword and cuts through them both in one strike. Instead of dying, however, the two mages simply fade away into the air.\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" Kate asks. \"If those two were in fact illusions, then does that mean that the real mages were hiding invisibly when they cast the illusion spell?\""

Immediately after the illusions disappear, Kate's freezing wave reverses its direction, and it hits us all before we get the time to react.\r\n\r\nAs the others each shake off the ice spell in their own way, I can feel myself slowly freezing to death, while my heartbeat gets slower and slower by the second.\r\n\r\n\"Kate, unfreeze him, quick!\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"I can't!\" Kate says. \"I don't know how!\"\r\n\r\nDaren rushes towards me and he tries to cast a healing spell of some sort on me, but it's too late for that. I can already feel my consciousness slipping away, as my vision starts to blur, little by little. I died shortly afterwards, without even finding out what it was that sent Kate's spell back against us."

None of them are the originals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you saying that the real mages were never actually here, and they just cast the illusion spell from afar?\" Daren asks.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Arraka says. \"I've been monitoring the whole area around us ever since I noticed that the streets were empty, and I guarantee you that the only mages who were close enough to cast an illusion spell on us were the two that ambushed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that makes no sense,\" I say. \"If those two were the real mages, then what happened to them? Did they just turn into illusions as well when they cast the spell?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, an idea comes to me.\r\n\r\n\"Wait...\" I say. \"I think I may be onto something, but I'll need some confirmation before I'm sure. Illuna, check my thinking. Could this all be an illusion? Not just the clones before us, but the whole world around us, too? You know, like that time with the shaman.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's impossible,\" Illuna says. \"If a mind affecting spell of that caliber had been cast on us, then there should have been a visual effect of some sort, for all of us to see, in the same way that the underground caverns were filled with smoke when the shaman cast his spell. There was no such--\"\r\n\r\nIlluna pauses for a second, as realization dawns upon her."

It's because the reverse is what actually happened. Their mind affecting spell could not target Rose, and so, it appeared to us as if she'd been rendered unconscious. It's probably the same for Flower as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great,\" Daren says. \"So we're back to square one, then. We need to find the real mages so we can kill them and get out of the illusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't,\" Illuna says. \"We only needed to do that with the shaman because he'd trapped himself in the illusion with us in order to prevent us from escaping, remember? Since the mages are not actually here with us, it means that this illusion's main purpose was not to kill us, but to buy time so that they could kill us in the real world while we were defenseless. This leads me to believe that time is flowing at the same speed here as in the real world, which is different from what we experienced in the shaman ritual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh gods,\" Kate says. \"If that's true, then it means that Flower has been fighting the two mages by herself in the real world all this time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Most likely,\" Illuna says. \"We need to get out of here quick. Everyone, close your eyes and start visualizing the moments before the mages cast the illusion on us. You need to do this with the conviction that the image in your head represents the real world, and that you want to return to it. If we all do this at once, we'll break the illusion's effect over us.\""

As I get a clear image of the city's streets in my mind, the image starts to become clearer and clearer, until I feel myself getting pulled into it, and suddenly I realize that my imagination had become reality without me even noticing it. As I open my eyes, I see myself standing in the middle of the street, but everything looks a lot different from how I remembered it. \r\n\r\nThere are craters all around us, the walls from the houses on the side of the street have all been charred, and there's a huge skeletal dragon standing right in front of us. Rose is on her knees, crying, and Flower looks like she's barely able to stand on her feet, but she's staring at the dragon defiantly. She is bruised all over, and her clothes are a complete mess, but there is a very intimidating aura surrounding her, feeling as if it were made from a fire hotter than that of her elemental magic. When Flower senses that we've finally awoken from the illusion spell, she turns to us and she gives us a tired smile.\r\n\r\n\"You broke the spell!\" the girl says. \"I knew you could do it. I knew it...\"\r\n\r\nAs she utters the last words, Flower's eyes slowly close, and then she drops to the ground, unconscious. Daren is now hurrying over to her side, in order to shield her from the dragon, in case it decides to strike her while she's down.\r\n\r\n\"She was so reckless...\" Rose says, as she's holding back her tears. \"She never stopped fighting even after she had clearly exceeded her limits.

It just targeted the soul that was controlling the body at the time and left the other one alone. There was no way I could have prevented it from happening. You're the only one to blame for this, you stingy bastard! If you had just used that stillwater summoning spell of yours when I told you to, they would have all died within seconds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, heathen,\" Zack says. \"I can only cast that spell once a day. It would be an insult to the great God of Death Ulruk if I were to waste its one daily use so early in the morning, on the likes of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you kidding me?!\" the green robed mage says. \"Do you have any idea how much magical energy I needed to spend in order to keep them in that illusion for so long? I had to cancel all of my protections two hours ago just so I'd be able to cast the damn spell! I don't even have my magic shield on right now!\"\r\n\r\nJust as the green robed mage stops talking, an ice cone passes straight through his head, and soon afterwards he falls on the ground, lifeless."

A very powerful wind is now blowing in our faces, pushing us all away from her, while the sky is becoming darker and darker by the second. The girl's eyes are now slowly turning from bright blue to pitch black, as she grins widely, while looking at each of us in turn.\r\n\r\n\"So this is what you all look like in the flesh!\" Arraka says. \"It was kind of hard to tell from inside the amulet, going by magical sense alone.

Shouldn't you rather be buying me that beer you owe me? I could really go for a drink right about now. That and mass murder. I'm still not sure which one I should be starting with!\"\r\n\r\n\"Flower...\" Kate says, weakly. \"What happened to Flower? Where are Flower and Illuna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're dead,\" Arraka says. \"Or should I rather say... 'absorbed'? What happened is that I merged with their souls when I took over their body. They're both part of me, now.\"\r\n\r\n”So, they're both still in there... somewhere?\" Kate asks."

Begone, foul demon!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the skeletal dragon, which had not moved an inch since we escaped the illusion, flaps its wings and rushes towards Arraka, roaring loudly. Just as it reaches her, the dragon explodes into a thousand tiny pieces that get scattered throughout the whole area around us.  \r\n\r\n\"Really, now...\" Arraka says.\r\n\r\nAs the dragon's bones fly in all directions, the ground begins to shake, and several skeletons start to slowly rise from it. It doesn't take me long to realize that this is the necromancer's doing, and that all of the skeletons standing in front of us are stillwaters.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand now, banshee?\" Zack says. \"Do you understand who you are facing against? This is the true power of the God of Death! If you get on your knees now and beg for Ulruk's forgiveness, he might just see fit to grant you a quick and painless death.\"\r\n\r\nArraka ignores the mage completely, choosing instead to stare intently at one of the skeletons that have risen from the ground."

Eventually, its pain turns into rage, and it roars loudly, as it starts shooting fire out of its hands. The fire simply brushes off Arraka's magical shield, and she acts as if nothing happened, continuing to sing her song."

Truly, you are a mage among mages.

Realistically, it'll probably break a lot sooner than that. So, yeah, if you're planning to look for weak spots, you'd better do it quick.\"\r\n\r\nIlluna is right. Even if they are stillwaters, their frail undead bodies are bound to leave them with a few exploitable weaknesses. Azarius has shown us this much. Even if the necromancer has learned from his past mistakes and shielded them against sonic attacks, there still should be something we could take advantage of. Not to mention that the necromancer's spell only lasts five minutes and is limited to one use per day, so barring any more unexpected time reversals, we should be in the clear if we manage to hold out for the entire duration of the spell."

I am honestly surprised that my stat device isn't reacting to any of this.

For a moment, I could see two additional stats being displayed on the device's screen, next to the nine existent ones. The stats were named 'Magical power' and 'Magical knowledge', but they disappeared almost as quickly as they appeared.\r\n\r\nI think I may be starting to understand what's happening here. This 'Emergency mode' somehow powers up two hidden stats that I don't normally have access to, but it only does so temporarily, when the device gets ahold of a surplus of energy that it can't assimilate immediately. This is how Eiden powered up my device for my fight with Tyrath. I'm sure of it. The feeling I'm getting is exactly the same as back then, even though I don't seem to have access to nearly as many spells as I did last time. \r\n\r\nThis time around, it seems that I don't have any flight or teleportation spells available, so I guess I'll have to move around the old fashioned way.

The magical energy is spread thin throughout the barrier, which helps a great deal against spells with a wide area of effect, but it should leave it vulnerable against more focused attacks. I start charging up a lightning attack in my hands, and when it becomes powerful enough, I aim it directly at the supporting mage, making sure that all of the power behind my strike is concentrated on a single point.\r\n\r\nMy lightning strike goes straight through the skeletons' barrier and it hits the supporting stillwater in the skull, killing him instantly. As the magical barrier starts to disappear, the other four skeletons that were hiding underneath it are now standing around, looking very confused. I take advantage of this and use a great deal of magical energy to create a large pool of acid underneath the stillwaters. \r\n\r\nThe skeletons were caught unawares and they had no time to react. As they all sink slowly into the pool of acid, the air elementalist uses a wind spell to lift the upper half of his body that hasn't yet melted into the air, but I quickly raise two chunks of rock from the ground, and I use them to smash the skeleton's head between them. Eventually, all of the skeletons sink fully into the acid, and as my device's energy depletes completely, the pool of acid disappears. The skeletons had, however, already completely melted before this happened, which means that the necromancer is now the only enemy left standing."

We should start by focusing on the necromancer, because the stillwaters will be forced to protect their master when we attack him, and that could make them break their formation.\"\r\n\r\nI pause a bit to think before I continue.\r\n\r\n\"Daren, I'm going to cast most of my protections on you,\" I say. \"Try to grab the stillwaters' attention as much as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, I can do that,\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Hadrik, I want you to put as much pressure as you can on their necromancer,\" I say. \"Once we exit the barrier, you should run straight at him and hit him with everything you've got.\""

        text: "Once I finish casting the protection spells, we step out of the barrier and start putting our plan into action. Hadrik dashes straight for the necromancer and reaches him in a matter of seconds, but the air elementalist reacts quickly, and he uses a wind spell to push Hadrik back several dozen feet. By the time Hadrik gets back, the supporting skeleton places a magical barrier around their master, which the dwarf is now trying to break with a flurry of fists.\r\n\r\nDaren heads for the five stillwaters, and when he comes close to them, one of the skeletons shoots a powerful beam of fire towards him. Daren uses his sword to absorb all of the fire, and then he sends it back towards his attacker. The skeletons' barrier defends them from the blow, but Daren's actions seem to have caught the stillwaters' undivided attention. They are now all firing spells towards him, while he uses his shield to block and his sword to absorb their elements. \r\n\r\nThis is what we were waiting for. I wave at Flower, and she nods her head, as she starts to run towards the stillwaters. While running, she jumps high into the air, and she then uses her fire jets to propel herself higher, as she goes to position herself above the skeletons' barrier. I follow her lead and use my air magic to lift myself into the air. Using air magic to fly is nowhere near as easy as it sounds, and I'm feeling a lot clumsier than when I was using the flight spell in my fight with the dragon, but it should be good enough for my intents and purposes."

Daren's hands are trembling as he looks towards the revenant, and he appears frozen in place. Even if he knows that it isn't Rose, it must still be hard for him to bring himself to attack her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, one more thing before I go,\" the revenant says, as she stops and turns her head towards us. This time, the empty look in her eyes is replaced with one of regret. \"Take care of the kids for me, will you? I don't think that I'll be coming back to that house anytime soon...\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" Daren shouts. \r\n\r\nHe then rushes towards the revenant and tries to slash her with his sword, but she disappears without a trace before he could land a hit, and the only thing that his blade gets to cut is empty air.\r\n\r\nAs we all stand there in silence, a loud booming noise suddenly starts to echo all throughout the city."

It appears that all of the screens are displaying the same thing, which is to say a gnome with messy hair, wearing protection goggles and an oil-stained lab coat, who is currently fiddling with some wires in some kind of a workshop, while he's humming a joyful tune.

First of all, I would like to begin with an apology to all of the mages that have joined this tournament. When you first arrived on the continent, you were all told that you'd be receiving your objectives privately, but unfortunately, the device that was supposed to be relaying these messages to you broke shortly after your arrival. I have been trying to fix it ever since, but given that a whole week has already passed, I decided to use this old transmitter as a temporary solution, until I manage to get the original device to work properly. Normally, this transmission should be reaching all of the cities of Varathia and even some areas in the wilderness, but since I can't guarantee that every single mage on the continent will be seeing this, I would like to ask you all to pass this information to your fellow participants who missed the announcement!\""
