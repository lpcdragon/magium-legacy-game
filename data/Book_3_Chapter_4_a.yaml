We're all fine, but we're not exactly sure where we are yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, I couldn't-- all that,\" Rose says. \"Where did you-- teleported?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know yet!\" I say. \"Some underground caverns that I can't recognize. We're going to need to explore a bit to find out more. I'll call you again once we're out of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Barry,\" Rose says. \"-- careful!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think this is one of the corridors from the rebel base?\" Kate asks me, as I close the communications channel and put the transceiver back in my pocket.\r\n\r\n\"No, I spent all my day exploring their tunnels and this place doesn't seem familiar to me at all,\" I say. \"I think we're still somewhere below the city, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with Barry,\" Breynan says. \"I know all of the corridors from our base, including the ones from the restricted areas, and this is certainly not part of our territory. There might be enemies nearby. We need to stay alert.\""

One thing I can sense, however, is that there are quite a few magical traps scattered throughout these corridors. It looks like we're going to need to disarm at least some of them before we can get out of here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Magical traps, huh?...\" I say. \"Damn, we could have really used Daren's help right about now. Does anyone else here even know how to disarm a trap? Illuna, I'm pretty sure Flower mentioned that you two have been visiting lots of ruins in the past. Those ruins must have had traps in them, right? How did you get past them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of the traps from the ruins were the old fashioned kind, so the girl would typically just use her acrobacy skills to escape unharmed,\" Illuna says. \"In the few cases where we've encountered magical traps, we had to rely on Arraka to dispel them. Flower and I are both elementalists, so disarming anything other than the most basic of magical traps is a great challenge for us.\""

            text: "\"Arraka can cast dispelling magic from inside her amulet?...\" Kate asks. \"I thought the spells she could cast were very limited in her current state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dispelling magic does not require a great deal of magical energy to cast,\" Illuna says. \"Arraka's main problem while she's inside the amulet is that she can only store a very small amount of energy within her aura at any given moment, so the only way in which she can cast any reasonably powerful spells is to channel the energy outside the amulet for hours on end, without being interrupted by anyone. It's not like she suddenly forgot how to cast spells when she got trapped in there. She still has all of her knowledge. That's why she can cast complex spells like detailed holograms, targets made of solid light and dispelling magic but she can't manage to cast a simple explosion spell to break herself out of her amulet. It would take her three whole hours to channel the energy required to generate a small explosion, as opposed to the half hour or so she usually needs to dispel a trap.\""

Please don't break my focus. It's already hard enough for me to keep her stabilized as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand...\" Kate says. \"I will let you work.\"\r\n\r\nAfter we all wait for about a minute in silence, Breynan finally gets up from the ground and he gives us his verdict.\r\n\r\n\"I've done all I could,\" Breynan says. \"She should no longer be in any life-threatening danger, but she's lost a lot of blood. It will take her a long time to fully recover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any idea what this place might be?\" I ask Breynan, as I nod my head towards the cavern walls surrounding us. \"I don't recognize it at all, and I've been through most of the tunnels from your rebel base.\""

'Your new stats have been successfully activated!

The next section will give a short explanation for each of the aura stats.

However, the results you will get from this stat will highly depend on your own aura reading abilities. If your magical sense is particularly weak, the effects may be less visible unless you invest a high enough amount of points into the stat.'\r\n\r\nAs I press the button on the right side of my device, I get a new text that describes another one of the aura stats.\r\n\r\n'The Aura Hardening stat's main purpose is to increase your defensive capabilities against magical attacks,' the text says. 'It should not be used as a replacement for the Toughness or Reflexes stats, because the defense it offers against physical attacks is minimal. Our tests have shown the Aura Hardening stat to be the most effective against traditional elemental magic, but it should also be useful against artificially created elemental magic such as electricity, acid and ice. Please be aware that the Aura Hardening stat will not defend you against non-magical elements, so you should still dodge incoming projectiles if they weren't magically created out of thin air.'"

However, you are not advised to attempt such a technique in an uncontrolled environment, because we were unable to replicate these effects in a reliable manner.'\r\n\r\nWhen I press the button on my device once more, the text for the third experimental stat appears on the screen."

Interesting... \r\n\r\nAs soon as I press the next page button, the stat screen finally appears and I can see that my three new stats have been added right below the other stats, which are currently all at level zero. I'm also noticing that I have an extra available point to spend. This must be the 'bonus' point that Leila's father said I would gain because of locking my stats by accident. The one that would cause me to gain one less point when I'll be getting my next batch.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll have to think whether I want to start investing my points now, or if I should wait until later before I make my decision."

If you are unable to use this stat to conceal your aura, please contact the person in charge of your stat activation, so they can readjust your device.'"

Besides, it's not like his joke was that much different from his usual ones. When he mentioned 'save slots', he was probably referring to those virtual pet devices that the gnomes modified recently to allow you to save your progress. And since we know from Arraka that those worlds we visited in the God of Time's ritual were practically alternate versions of our reality, Barry was probably comparing this situation to having multiple 'game saves'. He was trying to compare reality to a game, where he would use one of his 'saves' simply for the purpose of seeing if he can survive until the end as a completely average person. Barry, isn't that what you meant?\""

It's not like she suddenly forgot how to cast spells when she got trapped in there. She still has all of her knowledge. That's why she can cast complex spells like detailed holograms, targets made of solid light and dispelling magic but she can't manage to cast a simple explosion spell to break herself out of her amulet. It would take her three whole hours to channel the energy required to generate a small explosion, as opposed to the half hour or so she usually needs to dispel a trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Arraka is not here with us to help with the traps, so you're our best bet right now,\" I say. \"You've seen her use the dispelling technique many times before, so you must know how it works by now, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing how it works and being able to perform it successfully are two entirely different things...\" Illuna says."

After Illuna and I taught Breynan the correct incantation for the acid spell, we also had to figure out in which order he needed to cast the other spells, which was by no means an easy task.\r\n\r\nAll in all, we had to spend about an hour just with this one trap, and then when we finally thought we were done, we stumbled across a way more complex magical trap not much further down the same corridor. Unfortunately, it didn't take us long to realize that the methods we used for the previous trap would no longer be effective on this one. The spells required here were simply too complex for Breynan to be able to handle on his own. However, if he were to cooperate with Illuna while using my multi-step dispelling technique, we would be faced with a whole new set of problems."

You base your assumption of the trap not getting accidentally triggered on the fact that people generally keep their flow stable when they cast these types of spells, but that is not the case for Flower.

Just do what I'm doing and you'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\nFlower nods anxiously and she places herself beside me, preparing to imitate my motions.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, so the first thing you're going to need to do is slightly bend your knees in order to make sure that the flow of energy remains stable,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Bend my knees,\" Flower repeats after me. \"Got it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Flower does what I said, I realize that her knees are both trembling and that she is for some reason looking even more anxious than before.\r\n\r\n\"Is... umm... is everything alright?\" I ask Flower.\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\" Flower says, in a somewhat shaky voice. \"Why would you need to ask? Just tell me what to do next!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right...\" I say. \"So, what you need to do now is put your left arm in front of you with the palm facing down, while keeping your right arm alongside your body with its elbow bent.\""

I'll get it right this time!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be better to start off again from the beginning,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Okay...\" Flower says, as she puts her arms back down, while all her body looks completely stiff.\r\n\r\n\"Right, so with both of your knees slightly bent, you first put the arm on your left side in front like this,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Got it!\" Flower says, as she tries to copy my movements again."

Yes, you're right, I forgot about the breathing. I'll do that right now!\"\r\n\r\nAfter hearing Illuna, Flower almost immediately calms down and then she begins to breathe deeply and slowly with her eyes closed. A few seconds of breathing exercises later, Flower opens her eyes again, looking completely relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready to begin again!\" Flower says, as she gives me a military salute. \"Awaiting your orders, captain!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's amazing!\" I say. \"She calmed down in an instant. Illuna, how did you do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flower has always been very bad at following instructions when feeling under pressure,\" Illuna says. \"I usually help calm her down in these situations by having her focus on my voice inside her mind, but you said that you didn't want any help from me, so I stayed silent this time around.\""

But I'm surprised that you know one of my spells, Barry! I never wrote about it anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flower, I already told you,\" Illuna says. \"This spell was first invented long before you were born. You just discovered it instinctively due to your ethereal nature. Anyway, I'll take it from here. I believe Flower should already know most of the spells required for this trap except maybe one or two. It will be faster if I just tell her which spells to use in reverse, than if you teach her the moves from scratch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, right...\" I say. \"Go ahead, then.\"\r\n\r\nJust like Illuna said, it didn't take long for Flower to learn the rest of the spells and to start disarming the trap. Once she began the dispelling technique, I moved closer to her so that I could see if there were any fluctuations in the trap's aura that might have led to it getting triggered, but fortunately, despite Illuna's worries, Flower managed to keep control of her magic flow until the end. Once she was done, the energy radiating from the trap slowly disappeared, indicating that the trap had been successfully disarmed."

Like for example, one of the royal guards?\" \r\n\r\n\"Hmm, now that you mention it, the aura did seem familiar,\" Melindra says. \"I guess it could have been one of the royal guards, but I'm not very sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"If by any chance that was Gontrok or the captain of the guards, we will be in for one hell of a fight...\" Breynan says.\r\n\r\n\"Only if they're still there, waiting for us,\" Melindra says. \"And I would find that very unlikely. If someone as powerful as them knew we were coming, they would have no need to hide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you do have a point,\" Breynan says.\r\n\r\n\"Let's try to pick up the pace a bit,\" Melindra says. \"I wouldn't want your friends at the rebel base to start sending out search parties to look for us because we've been missing for too long.\""

We quickly realize that this was the secret door she was talking about earlier, so we approach the area as well and try to look for clues that might help us open the hidden passage.\r\n\r\n\"Step aside,\" Illuna tells us. \"I've seen Fyron opening secret underground tunnel doors more than enough times to know that you're doing it all wrong. Let me see if I can remember how he does it...\"\r\n\r\nShe then goes near the black cavern wall and she knocks on it two times, while directing some of her magical energy into its seredium surface. Reacting to her touch, the wall slowly retracts inside the tunnel behind it, and then it slides to the side, leaving enough space for several people to enter the secret corridor at once. As Melindra has guessed, the passageway leads directly to a set of stairs made of stone, which are heading in an upwards direction, presumably towards the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Nicely done!\" Melindra says. \"Let's see where this leads, then.\""

I don't recognize it at all! When did we get out of the rebel base?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, we're kind of in a bit of a hurry right now,\" I say. \"We'll explain all the details when we get out of here. The short version is that we went outside but when we tried heading back, the teleportation went wrong so we got stuck in these empty underground tunnels that we've never seen before. We think that this secret tunnel in front of us may lead to the surface, but there could also be enemies waiting for us at the end of it, so we need to be prepared for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got it!\" Flower says. \"Okay, I'm ready.

Once you've cut off the connection by force, there is no way to undo the damage.

There is nobody else in this room who could hear them aside from us. After about half a minute of continuous screaming, the light from the chains and the container finally fades away, and the prisoners fall silent once more. Meanwhile, Flower is looking absolutely terrified, Kate is barely able to hold her composure, Breynan seems like he's going to be sick, and Leila looks as if she's having some Beacon of Hope flashbacks.\r\n\r\nJust as we thought everything was over, we hear the one voice that we wanted to hear the least right now, coming from somewhere a few dozen feet behind us.\r\n\r\n\"Did you enjoy the spectacle, Barry?\" Eiden says, with a grave tone in his voice.\r\n\r\nI turn around quickly, but I don't see him anywhere.

That's why your aura seemed so familiar. You were just masking it so I couldn't recognize you from afar!\"\r\n\r\n\"What will happen first, I wonder?\" Eiden continues to address me, while ignoring Melindra. \"Will your resolve eventually break when you'll finally understand just what exactly you've gotten yourself into? Or will you be able to achieve the impossible, like you've claimed? Regardless of what happens, I hope you will continue to keep me entertained. Do not disappoint me.\""
