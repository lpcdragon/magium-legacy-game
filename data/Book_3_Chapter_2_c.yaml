            text: "\"Maybe somebody else is also trying to assassinate the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does bring up a good question...\" Hadrik says. \"If the king is already dead by the time we find him, wouldn't that mean that our enchanter's oath with Melindra would become voided?\"\r\n\r\n\"Voided or not, as long as you'd help me get what I want from him, I would still consider our agreement valid,\" Melindra says. \"Of that much, you can be certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shouldn't stay here for too long,\" Daren says, as he grabs his sword from the ground and then starts slowly limping towards us. \"Even if the royal guards are gone, the regular city guards could still be arriving here any minute. We should look for a place to hide, where we can rest for a while and recover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn...\" Hadrik says, as he looks at the way Daren is barely able to stand on his feet. \"What happened to you? You look like someone just dropped a house on you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're one to talk?...\" Daren says, as he finally manages to arrive at our position. \"Have you taken a look in a mirror, lately? Your face is all swollen and you're full of bruises. I'd heal you up, but I'm just too weakened to do it right now. I barely even managed to cast a recovery spell on myself, to get me back on my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree that we should go look for shelter,\" Kate says, as she takes a quick look at the now mostly empty plaza around us. \"The longer we stay here, the more vulnerable we become. I can't say that I have any idea on how we could find a safe place in the middle of this enemy territory, however...\""

I have missed you so much!\" the man says, as he hugs his daughter tightly.\r\n\r\n\"Father, these are my friends,\" Leila writes, as soon as she releases her father from her arms. \"They helped me get out of prison and they escorted me all the way here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think I got the general idea,\" Leila's father says. \"I am very grateful to you all for taking care of my daughter for so long, but I recommend that we leave the introductions for later, when we are safely away from here.\""

I think 'Barry' is a wonderful name!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, thanks, Doc!\" we hear a voice coming from the transceiver. \"But why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't talking to you...\" Leila's father says, as he puts the transceiver next to his mouth again. \"I was speaking with another Barry which-- you know what, never mind that! Do you think you can teleport us safely? Can you tell where we are from the signal of this transceiver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I can get a good reading on you,\" the voice from the transceiver says. \"Should I teleport you right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Leila's father says. \"But make sure you transport all of us. We wouldn't want anyone to get left behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Roger that,\" the voice from the transceiver says. \"Here we go!\""

        text: "As soon as the voice stops talking, we all feel ourselves getting teleported out of the alleyway, as a white light begins to envelop us. A few moments later, we find ourselves standing in the middle of a dimly lit cave, in which the only source of light we have are some glowing blue crystals embedded in the walls. Upon looking around myself, I realize that the walls and the high ceiling are all made of seredium, and there are also some peculiar looking plants growing in this cave, which can probably only be found in underground places such as this.\r\n\r\nThe man named Barry that Leila's father was talking to earlier is standing behind some sort of metal desk with several buttons on it, and behind him, there is this very big metal device with many lights of different colors illuminating it, which I can only assume is the teleporter that was used to transport us here. I did hear that Varathians had access to technology such as this, and I'm pretty sure that it is through the use of one such device that we were brought here, to this continent, but this is the first time I've had the chance of seeing one up close.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Barry, for bringing us here,\" Leila's father says, to the man behind the desk."

And these are Leila's friends, who helped her reach Ollendor. Sadly, I haven't had the time to learn their names yet. Leila, could you please introduce us?\"\r\n\r\nLeila nods, and she displays each of our names above our heads, written in her usual blue writing.\r\n\r\n\"Pleased to meet you all!\" Leila's father says. \"I am Reidzek, these two beside me are Peter and Albert, and that man over there by the desk is Barry, as you already know.\""

Reminds me of how I used to be friends with two other Barrys when I was a kid, and how we all had to give ourselves nicknames to keeps things from becoming too confusing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's how we did it in my homeland too,\" Hadrik says. \"Whenever there were other Hadriks around, people just used to call me 'dwarf'. Maybe we could find some nickname for our Barry too. Like Barry, the improviser. Or Barry, the reckless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just 'Barry' is fine, thank you very much,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be like that, 'reckless',\" Hadrik says with a grin. \"I'm sure we could find a nickname that would be to your liking. Or we could add your father's name at the end of your own name, kinda like how those nobles from the Western Continent like to add their family names at the end sometimes, to make themselves feel more important! What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to force him to use a nickname if he doesn't want to,\" the man behind the desk says. \"I already have an old nickname that I'm used to, so you can call me by that name, if you feel that it would be less confusing.

I think so...\" the man behind the desk says. \"I remember that they told me about it during my initial briefing, but it's been a long time since then. Doctor, you had your briefing somewhat recently. Do you remember if the teleporter is located below Ollendor or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this teleporting device was placed somewhere below the center of the city, I believe,\" Leila's father says. \"But we are very far below. This ceiling that you see high above us is made up of a massive layer of seredium, and as far as I know, there is no other way to reach the surface than to use this teleporter. These underground tunnels stretch for miles and miles, however, so it is not impossible that there is some exit that leads to the surface somewhere, but it's like a huge labyrinth down here, so you would be more likely to get lost and starve to death, than to find your way out.\""

Not doctor Reidzek. The doctor told us once that his daughter had silver hair, so as soon as we saw you and your group, we immediately contacted Barry over here, so he could tell the doctor and teleport him to the surface. When we saw you pick a fight with the royal guards, we panicked a little, but we managed to convince the king of the underground to send some of our men to create a diversion at the temple where they were holding the ceremony, in the hopes that this would get the royal guards off your back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a second...\" Daren says. \"So you're saying that you are the ones who set off that explosion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of our comrades did, yes,\" Albert says. \"We knew that the king tends to teleport the royal guards to his position, whenever he feels that his life may be in danger, so we figured that an explosion should be more than enough to scare him a little.\""

Call me in thirty years, and tell me how that's worked out for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway...\" Albert says. \"The important thing to know about this Overseer is that from what we've gathered, it does not seem to be on very good terms with Billy Bob, the lessathi, which is why it hasn't yet been granted full control of the 'drowns' in the city, and it is still labeled as an 'experimental' protocol. We have reasons to believe that the Overseer has plans of its own, although it is unclear to us what exactly it is trying to accomplish. In either case, if we were to win it to our side, we would potentially gain a great ally, because those 'drowns' are most certainly a force to be reckoned with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you people keep calling them 'drowns'?\" Melindra says. \"I'm pretty sure the correct name was 'droons'.

My father and brother for even longer than that. These people said they'd help me. They said they'd help me find them, but they lied!

All of her family had been taken away by the city guards, and she had nowhere to go. Her father and brother were mages, and they both disappeared without a trace from their homes one night, never to be heard from again. They aren't the only mages that have been taken away by guards all of a sudden, without any explanation, in the past few years. These sorts of situations have been happening increasingly more often as the years went by, and people barely have the courage to talk about it anymore, out of fear that they may become the next ones to get dragged out of their homes in the middle of the night, if they are not careful with their words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any idea why they might be doing this?\" Daren asks Breynan, as I see Albert and Peter stopping in the middle of the room to have a discussion with one of their friends, while the little girl is just standing there, with her head bowed down."

        text: "\"Given that the majority of their targets so far have been mages,\" Breynan says, \"we're thinking that they may be taking them to those large black towers, coated with seredium. I don't know if you've seen how they work, but those towers are basically the main source of magical energy for all of the gadgets in this city, from the flying metal carriages, to those metal balls roaming the skies. The energy in those towers is coming from all the mages that you see standing on the flying platforms on the side of them, and also from all the mages that are inside the towers. These people work all day to transfer magical energy to the tower, and in return, they get paid for their services. But I think Billy Bob wasn't happy with the amount of energy he was getting from voluntary work, so he decided to have some of the mages kidnapped, so they could work day and night at the towers, without pay. We don't know this for certain, of course. So far, it is only speculation on our part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not been to those towers to see if you could find the girl's father and brother there?\" Daren says."

As cruel as this may sound, there are unfortunately more important things to spend our resources on than finding a little girl's family.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the girl's mother?\" Hadrik asks. \"Do you know what happened to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her mother went missing shortly after she began asking the city guards to investigate why her husband and son had disappeared,\" Breynan says. \"She must have insisted a little too much and gotten on one of the guards' nerves. Only the gods know where she may be now... If she is still alive, that is.\"\r\n\r\nAs I look towards the other end of the hall again, I see that Albert and Peter have finished their conversation with their friend, and they are almost about to exit the room, with the little girl following close behind."

If I'm telling you that it can't be done, then it can't be done! You're just going to throw your life away for nothing! Don't you get it? There's nothing you can do to save them. It doesn't matter how good of a healer you are. Nobody can achieve the impossible!\""

        text: "\"That doesn't mean that I can't still try!\" Daren says, with a very determined look in his eyes. \"Listen to me, Desmond. When I came here to this tournament, I promised myself that I wouldn't get distracted. I swore that I would focus on my goal of winning the tournament regardless of what would happen, because winning the Magium is what's most important. If I were to win the Magium, everything else that I couldn't do before would become possible, and I could potentially save tens of thousands of lives in the time that would have normally taken me to save only one. But none of that matters right now. None of it matters, because by the time I'll win the tournament... by the time I'll finally gain access to the Magium... all of those people behind that door will be long dead, and I cannot let that happen. I would never be able to forgive myself if I did.\"\r\n\r\nDaren then takes one step forward, and he puts both his hands on the guard's shoulders, as he looks him straight in the eye."

Even more of a fool than that idiot Kelrim.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard then begins opening the locks one by one, until he's finally done with them, and then he opens the iron door.\r\n\r\n\"Do as you wish,\" Desmond says. \"But know that you only have one week at your disposal. If in one week you don't make any progress, you either keep out of our base, or we'll lock you in with the rest of them. Don't say that I didn't warn you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" Daren says. \"I'll make sure not to waste this chance you've given me.\"\r\n\r\nDaren then turns towards me.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go, Barry!\" he says."

The rest of the room is full of sick people lying on their beds, coughing violently or just simply staring at the ceiling. And in the middle of all these people, to our surprise, we see a lone goblin dressed in white mage robes that is currently walking from one bed to another, tending to the sick, while apparently being too focused on his work to have noticed us entering the room.\r\n\r\n\"A goblin?...\" Daren asks, seemingly in a state of shock. \"A goblin is the one taking care of all these people?\"\r\n\r\nAfter staring at the goblin for a few seconds, dumbfounded, Daren immediately snaps out of it, when he sees the goblin casting a healing spell on one of the patients.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" Daren says loudly, and then he begins limping in a hurry towards the goblin. \"That's not how you cast that spell!

Once the spell is cast, Daren lets go of the goblin, and then he takes his hand off the sick man as well.\r\n\r\n\"See, this is how it's done!\" Daren says. \"You really shouldn't risk casting these advanced spells unless you have full control over them. You could very easily injure yourself with one of these, if you're not careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for the advice, kind stranger,\" the goblin says in the Common language, with a surprisingly good accent. \"As you could probably tell, I am only a novice in the arts of healing, but I do what I can to help.

Aren't you an outsider here? Aren't these humans all strangers to you? So why would you have any reason to want to save any of them? The answer is simple. It's because we are both healers, so it is in our nature to care about other's lives, regardless of their race or species. Is this not the reason why you began learning white magic in the first place? To help make a difference?\"\r\n\r\n\"I...\" Daren says, but he can't seem to be able to find his words. \"I don't...\"\r\n\r\n\"By the gods!\" Kelrim says, as he moves towards one of the other beds, and he sees the back of Daren's neck accidentally. \"Your neck!

Unfortunately, I was in the middle of a meeting that just couldn't be interrupted, so I wasn't able to invite you to meet me right away. Given that I'm the one who kept you waiting, I figured that I should come and escort you personally, as an apology.\""
