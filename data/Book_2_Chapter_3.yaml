        text: "Illuna's friend was waiting for us in an area not far from the one where the trolls ambushed us. He was leaning on a wooden staff, with several dead trolls lying on the ground around him, and he was studying us closely, as we approached him. \r\n\r\nHis appearance shocked me at first, but when I saw Illuna nod to him, I immediately realized that he was the one that she brought us to meet. Illuna's friend was no taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, a crooked nose, pointy ears, and green skin. \r\n\r\nI must admit that I wasn't expecting this friend of hers to be a goblin, but given the fact that Illuna is a banshee, I suppose that I shouldn't find it too strange that she'd have a few monster allies in Varathia. I've heard before that goblins are supposed to be really smart, compared to other monsters, but this goblin in particular has a very shrewd look about him, and his cunning grin reminds me of those slimy merchants that are constantly looking for new ways to rip you off. And he's not trying to hide it, either."

        text: "His high intelligence is likely a result of his old age, which I've heard is not an easy feat to achieve if you live your life as a goblin. Most goblins die young, either because of starvation, or because they get killed, while trying to steal food, in order to survive. Since they are considered monsters by other civilized races, they are forced to live from scraps, and often need to resort to illegal activities such as smuggling and stealing in order to get the goods they require. But this goblin's skin is all wrinkly, which means that he must have lived well over two hundred years, given how slowly goblins are known to age, compared to humans. Living this long as a goblin, especially in a place like Varathia, is definitely not something that you can achieve through sheer luck.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the lessathi you were talking about, Illuna?\" the goblin says, in the Common language, as he looks towards me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"And the lessathi girl?\" the goblin asks. \"Is she from your group too?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lessathi girl is apparently a teammate from his arena division,\" Illuna says. \"I only just met her, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmm...\" the goblin says. \"If she's a gladiator, then I suppose I can safely assume that she has nothing to do with Meridith's group. I'll admit that I was a little worried, at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" I say. \"You're telling me that you can both tell she's a lessathi from just one glance?\""

She is a gladiator, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute!\" I tell Illuna. \"If we're talking about trust, then the same question goes for him as well. Just how much are you willing to trust this guy? To me, he looks just about as trustworthy as a swindler who would try to trick you into playing a rigged game of cards, on the main streets of Bagelberry.\"\r\n\r\nThe goblin laughs out loud, after hearing what I had to say about him.\r\n\r\n\"I like this one,\" the goblin says. \"He speaks exactly what's on his mind without making any effort to sugar-coat his words.\""

I want to make him an offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What offer?\" I ask.\r\n\r\n\"I will offer him his freedom, if he agrees to join my goblin camp, and to be part of my army,\" the goblin says.\r\n\r\n\"You have an army?\" I ask him, confused. \"I thought you were just some random goblin that was acting as Illuna's informant.\"\r\n\r\nThe goblin laughs again.\r\n\r\n\"There really isn't any limit to your bluntness and disrespect, is there?\" the goblin says.\r\n\r\n\"The goblin you are talking to is Fyron, the general of all free goblins,\" Illuna says, in a bored tone. \"He is at the top of the hierarchy of all the goblins from Varathia that are not under Tyrath's rule.\""

I can make out most things with my magical sense, so I don't really need my eyesight for anything important, but to me, the girl's drawings in the air were just magical particles, floating around at random.

Well, it seems that the owner of the arena liked the story so much that he decided to build his own underground labyrinth, as soon as he got hold of a minotaur. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to visit these tunnels since the maze was created, so once we reach it, I won't know my way around as well as I have so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that will be a problem,\" Illuna says, \"since there will likely be no need to hide ourselves anymore, once we reach the maze. They will surely have caught on to our presence by then.

The walls inside the labyrinth look a bit different from all the rocky walls that we've seen in the caverns so far. They are black as coal, and they appear to be made from a different material.\r\n\r\nFyron, who seems to have spotted the difference as well, gets closer to one of the walls, and he looks at it curiously. He swipes the wall briefly with his index finger, and then he brings the finger closer to his face, studying the black powder that has accumulated on the tip of it attentively.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Arraka,\" the goblin says, \"are you sensing any trolls nearby?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Arraka says. \"No, I already told you that the coast is clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Fyron asks.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of question is that?\" Arraka says. \"Of course I'm sure!\""

This is how they must have been fooling us for so long. If they've got illusions like this set up, then I wouldn't put it past them to also have a spell cast on this place that messes with our sense of direction. That would explain why Arraka's map didn't help. It doesn't matter, though. If my intuition is correct, we should be almost there.\""

A few minutes later, when we were almost at our destination, we encountered a few more trolls, who were likely the ones chosen to guard the minotaur's cell. They barely got the time to react to our presence, before Illuna sliced their heads off, with her signature water whip.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to burn the bodies?\" I ask the goblin.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not wasting any more energy from my staff for something this trivial,\" Fyron says. \"If you want, you can hide the bodies yourself.

You can find us there when you're done.\"\r\n\r\nAs the others head towards the minotaur, I prepare to lift one of the troll bodies, when I notice Leila walking to the other end of the corpse and then grabbing it by the legs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I say to her, when I understand what she is doing. \"Thanks!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiles at me, and then we both grab the troll's body and carry it over to a nearby secret passage. There's not much we can do about all the blood on the floor, but given the darkness of the corridor, at least it will be harder to notice from a distance than a bunch of corpses lying in plain sight. Once we're done moving all the bodies and the heads into the passage, we close the secret door, and we hurry to catch up with the others. Just as we approach them, Fyron uses his staff to cast a spell on a magical panel from a wall. The panel fizzles, and it unlocks the gate of a cell near it.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect,\" the goblin says, as he sees me and Leila approach. \"You've arrived just in time!\"\r\n\r\nWith the gate now open, the prisoner inside the cell steps outside. He has the head of a bull and the body of a man, but he is taller than Daren and has twice the muscles. The minotaur takes a quick glance towards us as he gets out, and then he turns towards the goblin.\r\n\r\n\"How are you planning to get me out of these caverns?\" the minotaur says."

The way he looks and dresses would normally make me peg him as a noble, if it weren't for the look in his eyes, which is similar to that of the goblin general's. That look makes him seem more like a war veteran that has seen many battles in his lifetime, than a pampered rich person who's lived his life in luxury.\r\n\r\n\"But, owner,\" Velgos, the troll says, \"these are the intruders who came here to free the minotaur!
