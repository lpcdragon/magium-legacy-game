I was keeping watch the whole time! Nobody even came close to your tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember that spell that Eiden keeps using to mask his presence?\" I tell her. \"Melindra also knows that spell.\""

Everybody is looking at us, and Leila can tell from the flow of my aura if I'm lying or not. I need to choose my words carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Uh, you see...\" I say, as I try to see Leila's reaction with the tail of my eye. \"Melindra forgot to pack her tent, and she asked if she could sleep with me for tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you just let her sleep with you?\" Kate asks me, suspiciously. \"Just like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes,\" I say, as I feel a drop of sweat slowly starting to form on the side of my forehead. \"She's here in my tent now, isn't she?\"\r\n\r\nLeila is just looking straight at me, without reacting in any way. Does she know that I'm bluffing? If so, then is she planning to let me off the hook, or is she going to rat me out later?"

Did our night together mean nothing to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry... What is she talking about?\" Kate says, with the same dark look in her eyes as before.\r\n\r\n\"Sleeping,\" I tell her, as I begin to pinch one of Melindra's arms very hard with my fingers. \"She is talking about sleeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why must you be so cold with me, my love?\" Melindra tells me. \"Did you already forget that you're the one who kept me up all night, until it was morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"He kept you up all night--\" Hadrik starts to say, but then his words suddenly turn into an uncontrollable wheezing laughter.\r\n\r\n\"All night long-- Ahahahahaha!\" Arraka says, as she begins to laugh as well.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard enough,\" Kate says, as she storms away from us, while Hadrik and Arraka are still laughing in unison."

That's all there was to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why exactly would he need to do such a thing?\" Kate asks.\r\n\r\n\"If you want more details, you can ask Barry,\" Melindra says. \"In the meantime, I'll be over there, by the river bank, collecting some more rocks. You guys have fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Barry?\" Kate says, as Melindra heads towards the river. \"What exactly are these details that Melindra was talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make things short,\" I say, \"Melindra forgot to pack a tent, and she didn't feel like asking Daren or Hadrik to lend her one, because she didn't really get along with them, so she decided to come to me instead.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you simply let her sleep in your tent?\" Kate says. \"Just like that?\""

Break it up. We need to get ready to leave soon, remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry, do you have anything to eat?\" Flower says, as the crowd in front of my tent begins to slowly disperse. \"I could make some food for you, if you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do have some food, but I'd have to be a fool to refuse your offer,\" I say. \"What kind of dish do you have in mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Flower says. \"The arena event reminded me of some old recipes that I knew. I don't know if you've ever had the opportunity to eat trampler stew or archer porcupine pie in the past, but they're both very rare dishes, normally suited only for kings. I'll have them made for you in a second!\""

I take my time to savor my meal, and while I'm eating, I can't help but notice the fact that the sky is particularly dark today, without even a small glimpse of sun being visible through the clouds covering it. There's going to be a storm coming soon. I can feel it.\r\n\r\nOnce I'm finished eating, I decide to begin dismantling my tent. The first thing I do is to crawl back inside and get my backpack out, but when I reach to grab it, I notice that there is also another backpack thrown on top of it. It does not take me long to realize that this backpack is Melindra's, and that she must have sneaked it inside my tent last night, while I was still asleep."

            text: "When I wake up the next morning from the sound of people dismantling their tents, I see that there is barely any light coming through my tent from outside. As I open the tent's zipper, I realize that this is because of the fact that the sky is currently filled with dark clouds, and there isn't even a small glimpse of the sun, even though it must have risen for at least an hour. It appears that most of the others have already woken up, and presumably, have already had their breakfast.\r\n\r\nNot long after I walk out of my tent, Melindra comes rushing towards me, with a fake smile on her face, and she grabs me by the arm with both her hands, pressing herself against me, just like she did yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, my darling, I've had such a wonderful time last night!\" Melindra says. \"Tell me, did you sleep well after I left your tent? Because I slept like a baby!\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry?...\" Kate asks me, as she's looking at me with a serious expression in her eyes. \"What is Melindra talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought it would have been obvious by now,\" Melindra says. \"Didn't you see me coming out of his tent last night? Surely it can't be that hard to put two and two together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, let go of me!\" I say, as I pull myself away from Melindra. \"Kate, listen, Melindra only came to my tent yesterday because she forgot to pack a tent and needed a place to sleep. Nothing happened, I swear!\""

Apparently, she must have sneaked it into my tent yesterday, while I was still sleeping. After exiting the tent, Melindra begins to walk away from it, but then she stops in her tracks, and she turns her head towards me. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot!\" she says, as she begins to slowly approach me.\r\n\r\nOnce she's close enough, she extends her right hand towards me, and she touches me with her palm on the upper side of my left arm. As soon as she pulls her hand away from me, I start to feel a strong wind blowing in my ears, although in reality, there should only be a light breeze in the air. The sound that I'm hearing in my ears because of the wind is making it very difficult for me to hear anything that's going on around me.\r\n\r\nMelindra is now looking at me, with a smirk, as she leans closer, to make sure that I can hear what she is about to say."

Damn it, come back, here!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Melindra heads towards the river bank, I can see the others' lips moving, but all I can hear is the sound of wind. Daren now appears to be looking at me and talking, but I can barely even make out a few words of what he's saying. Seeing that he's getting no response, Daren gets closer to me, and he begins to shout in my ear.\r\n\r\n\"What spell did she cast on you?\" Daren shouts, as loud as he can.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know!\" I shout back at him. \"Some wind spell. I don't recognize it. There's a constant wind blowing in my ears and I can barely hear you speak!\""

It's been hundreds of years since then, so I've completely forgotten about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me!\" I say. \"And what about all those other men that you used this energizer spell on? Did you seriously not notice that they had headaches all day after spending the night with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Melindra says. \"Well, I never really stuck around long enough to see the side-effects kick off before. But don't worry, I'll just cast another energizer spell on you when you start to get the headaches, and you'll be fine!\""

I'm just saying, you don't really have a lot of options, here. It's not like a little headache is going to be the end of the world, when you're safe in your camp and don't need to be constantly alert to your surroundings.\""

It's only been getting darker since we woke up this morning. I have a feeling that there will be a storm coming soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you get storms often in Varathia?\" Hadrik asks Flower."

But I can't sense anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's one of Eiden's spells,\" Melindra says. \"It's designed to remain hidden from people without a keen enough magical sense. I can tell that it's been cast by him from the aura signature, but I can't tell what it's supposed to do. It must be some sort of spell that he designed himself, although I'm not familiar with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I remember seeing this spell in plenty of other places in the past week,\" Arraka says. \"Eiden must have been casting it all over the continent since he came back here. And he's probably still doing it, as we speak. Casting complicated spells like these takes a lot of time and concentration.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what does it do?\" Kate asks.\r\n\r\n\"How should I know that?\" Arraka says. \"It's not like I'm some spell researcher. I can't tell what a spell as complex as this does just by looking at it. But there's one thing that I can tell for sure, and it's that the spell is waiting to get triggered by something. Whatever that is.\""

Maybe they're all bombs, and they're meant to explode when they detect a lessathi nearby.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she hears this, Leila suddenly takes a few steps back from the area that Melindra is inspecting.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" Hadrik continues, \"I'd say it's pretty clear by now that Eiden and the lessathi aren't exactly best buddies. He told Barry to deliver that threatening message to them, and from what I can understand, he's killed a bunch of them in the still winter, so it's not like he'd need any special reason to kill more of them now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you babbling about?...\" Melindra says, as she's still concentrating on analyzing the hidden spell. \"Eiden never killed any lessathi during the still winter. He took their side...\"\r\n\r\n\"He did what?...\" Hadrik asks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh...\" Melindra says, as she suddenly realizes what she's done. \"I don't think I should have told you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, so Eiden fought against the stillwaters in the still winter?\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yeah, he killed plenty of them during that time,\" Arraka says. \"Almost as much as me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Kate asks. \"Weren't you the leader of the stillwaters during the still winter war?...\""

We tried to take over the body from each other constantly. But the most hilarious thing happened when he had to go to sleep for the first time. There was no way for him to stop me from taking over his body anymore, so I wreaked havoc all throughout his camp. Those idiots tried to kill me along with him, but I squashed them like bugs. I still left half of them alive, though, so that I could play some fun games with them. You should have seen Therius' face when he woke up to see the dead bodies of his friends. And the funniest part was that none of his friends would ever follow him of their own free will after that, so he had to lead them through fear and intimidation from that moment onwards. Oh, man, those were the days!\"\r\n \r\n\"But what triggered the still winter?\" Kate asks. \"Why were the lessathi and the stillwaters at war with each other? And why wasn't Eiden on the side of the stillwaters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you seriously think I was paying attention?\" Arraka says. \"I only just told you that I massacred half of my own army in one night. It's not like I cared to hear their reasons for going to war.\""

I continue to eat for a few more minutes, and once I'm done, I open up my backpack and I place the pack of biscuits back inside.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding whether I should be taking my notebook out of my backpack to read some more, I take a quick look towards the others, to see what each of them is doing. Kate is currently eating alone, while sitting on the grass, with her back against a tree. Meanwhile, Leila seems to have been coaxed by Hadrik and Daren to act as referee in a rock throwing contest between them. As with most contests that I've seen between Hadrik and Daren in the past, the rules appear to be a convoluted mess, and it's very hard to tell what the actual goal of their game is. And lastly, Flower and Melindra appear to be continuing their discussions about random topics that they started this morning."

With a little luck, the storm won't be as bad as Flower said it would be, and we'll get to continue our travel normally, without getting delayed.\"\r\n\r\nWe follow Melindra for half an hour or so, and during this time, the wind intensifies considerably. After a while, we start seeing lightning, and shortly afterwards, we get to experience a downpour of rain of the likes we've never seen before. It takes less than a minute for all of us to get completely soaked, and the powerful wind spraying the rain drops in our faces makes it feel almost like we're under a waterfall, instead of simply walking through some rain. As we move forward, the wind starts to blow even harder, and now it really does look like the trees are about to be pulled from their roots."

We should always be careful to have tall trees surrounding us, so the lightning will strike them instead of us. Make sure to avoid flying at all costs. Come on, keep moving!\"\r\n\r\nAs we advance through the storm, I find myself struggling to keep focusing on my surroundings, due to the intense headaches and feeling of nausea, but at least I'm capable enough to continue walking without needing to take a break.\r\n\r\n\"Watch out!\" Daren shouts.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a tree that is ten times the size of Daren gets blown out of its roots by the wind, and it falls right next to us, as we all make a quick jump backwards.\r\n\r\nDamn, that was close. I don't think I would have even noticed that tree without Daren's warning. I really need to pull myself together before I end up--\r\n\r\n\"Barry, behind you!\" Daren shouts at me.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the tone of Daren's voice, I quickly realize that I have no time to turn around, and no time to think, so I let my instincts guide me instead, and I jump out of the way of the falling tree behind me, right at the moment when it was about to crush me under its weight.\r\n\r\nAs I look at the large trunk of the fallen tree in front of me, I realize, with shock, that if I reacted only a fraction of a second later, I would have been done for."

You were less than a second away from dying right now, Barry. Do you understand that? Next time, you won't be so lucky. You're going to let Melindra cast that damn energizer spell on you, and that's final! No more excuses!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah...\" I say. \"I think you're right. That was way too close... Melindra, you can cast the second energizer spell on me whenever you're ready.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing my words, Melindra gets close to me, and she says an incantation, while pointing her hands towards me. As soon as she's done, I can feel my headache going away, along with my nausea and my feeling of fatigue. However, for some reason, I'm feeling nowhere near as energetic as I was the first time when she cast the spell on me.\r\n\r\n\"Is it just me, or does the spell have less of an effect this time around?\" I ask Melindra."

It should, however, hold you at least until we make camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" Daren says. \"Now that we've got this problem out of the way, let's keep going. As long as we all pay attention, we should be able to avoid other falling trees easily enough.\"\r\n\r\nWe keep pressing forward for another twenty minutes, but the storm still doesn't look like it will be stopping anytime soon. In fact, it's been getting worse by the minute. Every time we hear a thunder, it feels almost as if someone set off a powerful explosion spell in our vicinity. The wind is now almost powerful enough to push us back while we're walking, and the number of rain drops has greatly increased as well. Will this storm never end?"

That's what I'll do.\r\n\r\nI leave my backpack next to the tree stump, and I head over to Kate, who is still eating her lunch by herself.

After a while, I notice that the others are slowly gathering up and preparing to leave, so I put the notebook back inside my backpack, and I get ready to join them as well.\r\n\r\n\"Prepare yourselves,\" Daren says. \"The rain could start pouring any minute now, judging by the intensity of the wind. Remember to stick together, and to watch out for falling trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going this way,\" Melindra says, as she takes the lead. \"Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nWe follow Melindra for half an hour or so, and during this time, the wind intensifies considerably. After a while, we start seeing lightning, and shortly afterwards, we get to experience a downpour of rain of the likes we've never seen before. It takes less than a minute for all of us to get completely soaked, and the powerful wind spraying the rain drops in our faces makes it feel almost like we're under a waterfall, instead of simply walking through some rain. As we move forward, the wind starts to blow even harder, and now it really does look like the trees are about to be pulled from their roots."

We should always be careful to have tall trees surrounding us, so the lightning will strike them instead of us. Make sure to avoid flying at all costs. Come on, keep moving!\"\r\n\r\nAs we advance through the storm, the wind finally manages to blow a few trees out of their roots, but we all manage to avoid sustaining any injuries by being alert and by paying attention to our surroundings.\r\n\r\nWe keep pressing forward for another twenty minutes, but the storm still doesn't look like it will be stopping anytime soon. In fact, it's been getting worse by the minute. Every time we hear a thunder, it feels almost as if someone set off a powerful explosion spell in our vicinity. The wind is now almost powerful enough to push us back while we're walking, and the number of rain drops has greatly increased as well. Will this storm never end?"

So, that happened... \" Hadrik says. \"Now, Barry, what were you going to tell us about Eiden's loopholes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wasn't going to tell you anything,\" I say. \"Because I haven't discovered anything new since I found the loophole about Daren's protection spells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spectacular,\" Melindra says. \"Well, at least you can now all rest assured that this crucial piece of information will never reach Eiden's ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn...\" Hadrik says. \"So, I guess we still don't know any of Eiden's weaknesses, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't say that we don't know ANY of Eiden's weaknesses,\" I say. \"It just depends on what you'd be willing to call a weakness. For example, do you remember that time when Eiden teleported us all to your location, right after you turned back into a giant and challenged everyone to a brawl?\""

This means that even if he has the ability to monitor everyone on the island with his magic sense, he still can't concentrate on everyone at once.

And I don't think they were exactly on the best of terms before that, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their relationship had been slowly degrading for a long time,\" Melindra says. \"I think it all started when the cities in Eiden's care began to introduce the concept of slavery, and it all went downhill from there. The fox had always blamed Eiden for all the messed up things that ended up happening in his cities. She kept saying that if he would have reined them in and imposed stricter rules on them, it wouldn't have gotten to this point. But back then, Eiden had this naive belief that all humans are inherently good, and that as long as they'd be left to their own devices long enough, they would find the right path. He thought that as long as people were given everything they needed, without having to work for it, and as long as they were given no reason to fight each other, they'd all live like one happy family. Well, we can all see how that turned out.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, are you telling me that he just gave up?!\" Daren shouts, all of a sudden."

        text: "\"Oh, no, he didn’t 'just' give up,\" Melindra says. \"He tried to reason with them for a long time. Much longer than your lifespan. And he did manage to lead them back on the right path a few times. But the more his expectations got betrayed, the more he stopped caring. I think it was when the people he trusted the most betrayed him that he finally lost it. I don't even remember their names. The king and queen of one of the cities. They seemed like such nice folk too... until it was uncovered that they were secretly running an underground show where people were getting eaten alive by dogs. I remember that after Eiden found out what they were doing, he organized a whole arena event just to have the king and queen eaten alive by the very dogs that they were using in their own events. It was shortly after this whole episode that Eiden told me he was finally giving up, and it was also around that time that he began closing his eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he was just going to let those bastards do what they wanted?\" Daren says, furiously. \"What about all the innocent people in those cities that had nothing to do with all the atrocities?\""

        text: "\"He stopped caring about them,\" Melindra says. \"He started calling them all sheep, and he said that they deserved everything that was happening to them. He even started to encourage some of the more messed up things that were happening in those cities, saying that it was 'what the people wanted'. It was around that time that the fox started to really lose her faith in him, and also when she began to impose all those ridiculously strict rules in her own kingdom, in order to avoid what happened in Eiden's cities at any cost. Eventually, Eiden just left the continent without a word, on a journey of self-discovery, or whatever the hell it was, and when he came back for the first time, twenty years ago, he heard about the animal hunting going on in Olmnar and... well I think you all know what happened then. That's when he had his official falling out with the fox, and then he left the continent again, soon afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Arraka says. \"He probably tried to tell her that he solved the problem by destroying Olmnar, when it was in fact his departure that caused the animal hunts to begin in the first place. What a moron!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh...\" Hadrik says. \"I'm not trying to interrupt or anything, but weren't Eiden and the fox just two old allies from the still winter? Why was Arraka joking about Eiden trying to win her heart back, earlier? Why does it matter if they had a falling out or not?\""
