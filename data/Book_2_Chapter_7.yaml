But, why enchanted weapons, specifically? Shouldn't the shield spell automatically defend you from most types of damage? What, are you cursed or something? And besides, why would it even matter? The shield spell is just a spell that they teach to beginner mages. Nobody really uses it in actual combat. It consumes too much energy, and it barely even absorbs enough damage to prevent you from dying, most of the time. The protections against specific types of damage should be much more effective. Not that I really bothered to learn any of those, what with my very durable giant skin and all.\""

I've tried many kinds of protection spells against physical damage, but none of them seem to work for me. The only one that kind of works is the shield spell, but it's barely even working against regular weapons, let alone enchanted ones. Enchanting my armor to be as durable as possible was the only way I found to give me some measure of protection against these types of attacks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh,\" Hadrik says. \"That's odd.

Learning the versions of the spells that can only be cast on myself was easier. I was never planning to work in a team, during my travels, so it seemed like a waste of time to learn the more advanced versions of the spells, if I'd never get the chance to use them. The barrier that I can cast with my shield has always been more than enough to protect civilians from harm during monster attacks. And it's not like I can just make a few adjustments and change the spells I already know so they can be cast on other people. I'd have to learn entirely different spells for this to work, and we've got no time for that. Just let it go, already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, I'm just saying,\" I say, \"If you had actually decided to specialize in only one type of magic like everyone else instead of going for both enchantment and white magic, this wouldn't have been a problem.\""

More like a side effect of whatever he's planning to do. Let's say, for example, that Eiden knows for a fact that he will be forced to fight Tyrath personally before the end of this tournament. If the dragon is to be believed, then such a fight would completely raze the continent, which would most likely erase all of Varathia's cities from the map.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn,\" Daren says. \"You might be right.

          Golmyck says, "in a subterranean chamber situated not far from this
          castle. The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss the political
          implications of the earl of Ollendor's murder, and how it will affect
          them and the city of Thilias in the coming weeks. At first, this
          gathering was supposed to be held after your trial and execution.
          However, as I suspected, Eiden's intervention forced them to postpone
          it until after the end of the arena fights. Since you all managed to
          survive, I am quite certain that they will have a lot to discuss,
          especially regarding the reaction that Ollendor will be having to this
          unexpected turn of events. The meeting is mandatory for all the four
          lessathi who reside in this city, so you will have the opportunity to
          attack them all at once, without fearing that any of them will find
          out what happened to their comrades, and go into hiding."

I've been trying to get it fixed for more than a week, but I still can't figure out what's wrong with it, so you can imagine how frustrating this has been for me.\"\r\n\r\nAs Golmyck goes to work on his device, Hadrik puts down his backpack, and he reaches within it, to pull out a deck of playing cards.\r\n\r\n\"So...\" Hadrik says. \"Anyone up for a game of cards?\"\r\n\r\nWe spend the next hour or so playing a card game that Hadrik learned from dwarven taverns. Apparently, one of the original rules of the game was that a player needed to take a sip of dwarven ale every time they lost a hand, but we had to scrap this rule for obvious reasons. The game involved a lot of bluffing, so it was no surprise that Leila was the one who came out on top, given that she could read auras, to tell if someone was lying. Since I was the one she could get a read on the easiest because of my 'spiky' aura, I eventually got tired of losing every single match, and I decided to take a break to read my notebook some more, in the hopes of finding more loopholes that Eiden might be using.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Daren,\" I say, after reading through the notebook for some time. \"Remember that one time when Eiden paralyzed every one of you?

So, you mean the advanced version from the standard white mage spellbook. And Hadrik, I assume that you are relying on your partial resistance that comes from being a giant in order to defend yourself from such spells?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hadrik says. \"But I got paralyzed completely, just like Kate and Daren, despite my resistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" I say. \"Well, do you guys know what these three defenses of yours have in common?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" I say, as I close my notebook. \"Which means that Eiden was not using a loophole, this time around. In fact, I don't think he was using paralysis at all. He must have been using a completely different type of spell, which has the same effect. Remember that time when Kate's friend left us all unconscious on the ground? She didn't use a sleep spell to do it. She used electricity. I'm suspecting that Eiden used a similar method to temporarily paralyze you. Didn't you all feel a shock right before you fell to the ground? I'm pretty sure you must have also felt a few other electric shocks afterwards, which were meant to keep you paralyzed for a longer period of time.\""

        text: "\"Come to think of it, yeah!\" Daren says. \"I did feel some electric shocks. But they didn't feel much different from the feeling you get from a normal paralysis, so I didn't really notice the difference at the time. But does this mean that Eiden can use electricity as an element, like Kate's friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it,\" I say. \"The spell that he used seemed to have certain rules and limitations, which would not have been the case if he could have used electricity freely, as an element. The electric spell that he used to paralyze you felt extremely similar to a spell that I had access to, back when I had my stat device powered up, so it's likely the same one. I don't remember every single detail about it, but it was one of those spells that you could only cast once a day, and I know for sure that one major drawback of the spell was the fact that the area of effect was extremely small. I mean, you could pretty much just roll over to the side, and the following electrical currents would not target you anymore. The only reason why it worked against you was because you three happened to be standing very close together, and because you didn't know what kind of spell you were up against. If you knew how it worked, then you could have just gotten out of the way at the exact moment before a new electrical current hit you, since the effect of the paralysis wears off a bit, right before each new shock.\""

        text: "\"Yeah, I very much doubt that I could have done that,\" Daren says, \"since I was trying to break free of the spell's effect the whole time, and it didn't work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's because the spell shocks you at faster intervals if it sees that you're trying to break free!\" I say. \"It doesn't work that way. You need to be relaxed, and to only try to escape at the very last second. Of course, you can't know how often it will shock you until you let yourself get shocked a few times, while counting the number of seconds for each interval. The intervals will not always be of the same length, but there will usually be a pattern that you can figure out. Once you're sure that you got the count right, you wait for the last moment, and only then you try to escape. Obviously, the easier way around this would be to use protection against electricity, but with the amount of energy it takes to keep that protection up and running, you'd have to be insane to use it at all times, on the off-chance that you'll get attacked by an electrical spell other than the standard ones.\""

At the exact same time, Leila also jumps at the scythes-wielding lessathi, and she twists a knife into his heart before he gets the time to react. \r\n\r\nA mere second later, before the other two lessathi even have the time to understand what is going on, Kate jumps backwards, getting out of the trap's range, and she extends her arm, pointing her palm towards one of the lessathi, who is wielding a trident-like weapon. An ice cone then shoots out of her palm and impales the lessathi right in the head. Daren, Hadrik and Flower are, however, still lying on the ground, paralyzed, which means that they must have messed up their timing."

As my eyes re-adjust, I see that there has been a clash between Leila and the lessathi while we were blinded, which has led to both of them dropping their weapons. Leila is on the ground, with her back against the wall, and the lessathi is now bending over to pick up one of her knives, in order to finish her off.\r\n\r\n\"Help me, Barry!\" a big blue text appears in front of me, as Leila looks at the lessathi with a terrified look in her eyes."

As soon as I remove my dagger from him, however, something completely unexpected happens. The form of the lessathi slowly fades into thin air, and it is replaced by that of Leila. At the same time, the Leila that was on the ground just a second ago has turned into the lessathi, who is now looking at me with a malicious grin.\r\n\r\nAn illusion?... No... No, no, no! It can't be!\r\n\r\nI turn Leila around, and I see that her eyes are closed, and she is no longer breathing, while the blood stain on her blouse keeps getting larger. Kate is now staring at me with an incredulous look in her eyes, as she seems completely paralyzed, even though she is far away from the trap's range. Taking advantage of my distraction, the lessathi quickly picks up one of Leila's daggers from the ground, and he slits my throat wide open, causing me to die in the next few seconds."

I guess I'll go immobilize the lessathi for now, and I'll figure out what's wrong later.\r\n\r\nJust as I'm about to reach the lessathi, Kate suddenly shoots three ice cones into Leila's waist, causing her to scream in pain. Wait... Scream? Since when can Leila scream?\r\n\r\nMy question soon gets answered, as the Leila that was on the ground slowly fades into thin air, and she is replaced by the lessathi from before, who is clutching at his abdomen, trying desperately to stop the bleeding. At the same time, the lessathi that was in front of me turns into Leila, who is now staring at the screaming lessathi in front of her, with her dagger still in her hand.\r\n\r\nAn illusion? It was an illusion all along? How did I not figure this out sooner?\r\n\r\nWhile I'm busy questioning myself, Kate wastes no time, and she finishes off the last remaining lessathi by sending an ice dagger flying into his head. She then turns to look at me, and she shakes her head in disapproval."

I'm not sure how to react to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just react like you always do,\" Kate says. \"With a quip.\"\r\n\r\nShe pauses, as she sees Daren and the others starting to free themselves from the effects of the paralysis trap.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" Kate says. \"We should search their headquarters and see if we can find anything useful.

Do you think that they may have emptied out their headquarters before this meeting, as a precautionary measure, on the off-chance that they actually got defeated?\"\r\n\r\n\"They may have done it way before that,\" I say. \"If they were already suspecting that the king's servant got followed here, they probably considered this location to be compromised, so they made sure to not leave anything of value in this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you're right...\" Daren says. \"So, I suppose we should be getting back to the castle, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Kate says. \"I'm definitely not going to find out any information about Diane from this place.

Some of them have pointy ends. Make sure you stay away from the trapdoor!\"\r\n\r\nThe gnome gives us an okay sign with his hand, and then Hadrik starts tossing all of the weapons through the hatch.

            text: "Since we needed to get up before sunrise the next day, we had to end the celebration early, in order to get at least a few hours of sleep, but the hours that we spent at that table were exactly what we needed, after what we'd been through in the past few days.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, while it was still dark outside, we all lined up in the yard, to give Rose our farewells.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you all the best, Rose,\" Kate tells Rose, after she's done hugging her. \"I promise that I'll never forget you!\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go again, making it sound as if this is the last time we'll ever see each other,\" Rose says, smiling. \"You didn't come here to die, did you? As long as you all stay alive, then I'm sure our paths will cross again. Not to mention that you also have those transceivers with you, so you can call me any time, without worries. It will be as if I were never gone from your group in the first place!\"\r\n\r\n\"I... suppose you're right,\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"And besides,\" Rose says, this time with a teasing smile, \"Barry told me that he will come back for me as soon as he wins the tournament, so if you'll still be travelling in the same group by then, we should be meeting again before long!\"\r\n\r\nHadrik laughs.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if Barry said that, then I'm sure it must be true!\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shut up,\" I tell him."

            text: "We all wave goodbye to Rose and we set out to find the northern gate. After losing our way a few times, and having to ask the locals for directions on numerous occasions, we finally manage to reach our destination, just as the sun rises, and as we get a good look at the city gates, we see that Melindra was already waiting for us there, with her back leaning against a wall.\r\n\r\nAs she waves at us, to make sure that we've spotted her, we quicken our pace, and we get ready to finally take our first step towards our original goal. After so much sidetracking, and so many delays, at long last, we can get back to what we came here to do. Participating in the Magium Tournament."
