Am I saying the name correctly? Is it pronounced 'drones'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what Billy Bob used to call them,\" I tell him.\r\n\r\n\"My king,\" Peter says, \"while I do understand the tactical advantages of engaging our enemy when it is in a weakened state, do you not think it would have been wise to wait until more of our troops were ready to join the battle?\""

An opportunity like this is too valuable to pass up, even if it means going into battle a little less prepared than we would have hoped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Breynan done teleporting everyone?\" Albert says, as he looks around, counting the people in the room. \"I'm still not seeing Herman or Howard. Will they be joining us after all or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Howard will not be coming with us,\" the king of the underground says. \"His wound from yesterday had reopened right after you teleported to the surface, despite all the healing he's received, so I was forced to ask him to stay behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is... unfortunate,\" Albert says. \"I know how much he wanted to be a part of the final mission to liberate Ollendor, so I can only imagine how tough it must be for him to get cast aside like this. What about Herman?\""

The last thing we'd want right now is to cause a malfunction in our teleporting device and leave ourselves stranded here, especially after our main technician has been imprisoned for treason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will Breynan not be joining us, my lord?\" asks one of the mages that teleported to the surface together with us.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the king of the underground says. \"I've asked Breynan to remain underground, because if he were to come with us as well, there would be nobody left to lead our people in case anything went wrong with our mission. I know that you are a member of his usual team and are not used to going on surface expeditions without his guidance, but you are one of our most competent fighters, so we really needed to have you with us today. I trust that you will handle yourself well even without your mentor, and that you will make him proud of your achievements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" the mage says. \"I will!\""

Somehow, it looks very familiar...\r\n\r\nAs my mind is slowly clearing up from the haze that it's been in this whole time, I suddenly remember the sensation that I had back when the Magium was possessing the Overseer and flinging my consciousness through all the separate planes of existence, including the ethereal plane.\r\n\r\nNow I get it... This is the ethereal plane. That's why it seemed so familiar! It's because I've been here before. How in the world did I end up in this place, anyway? And where is everybody else? Did the Overseer's drones somehow throw them out in this wasteland too? Did they do it by using the blue crystals? I need to get away from here and find my friends. If only I could move somehow.

I only have my hands, not my entire arms, but I should still be able to get some use out of them, right?\r\n\r\nAs I instinctively do a swimming motion with my hands, I can feel myself advancing through the light, although there aren't really any points of reference around here, so there's no easy way for me to confirm my travelling speed.

Wait, how come you have your whole body and I don't?

When she heard about this, Leila immediately panicked, and she told me that you're exactly the type of person who overthinks things in these sorts of situations to the point that you may well end up dying of suffocation. But you never tried to do any of that, did you, Barry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, actually...\" I say. \"I may have been only a few moments away from trying to breathe at one point.

For someone like you, who is neither used to the ethereal plane nor to casting magic in general, it would be necessary to be familiar with the movement of every individual magical particle making up the flow of a spell, and to control both their direction and intensity flawlessly. That is of course, on top of already knowing the theory behind the spell.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, if I know all that stuff, I should be able to cast the spell?\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"In theory, yes,\" Illuna says. \"But I don't see how you could be able to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" I say. \"I'll try to cast one right now, then.

Does that make sense to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it does, yeah...\" I say. \"That's how you cast spells as an elementalist, right? I remember doing something similar when I had my magic stats unlocked during my fights with Tyrath and the stillwater skeletons. The problem is that I don't really feel any energy inside me while I'm casting spells in this realm, so I can't make use of this information. Isn't there anything you could tell me about the direction of the flow? For example... what direction do you instinctively look at when you start casting the spell? What about afterwards? I'm pretty sure that the way you move your eyes as an elementalist should be the most indicative of the direction that the flow of magic is supposed to take.\""

As luck would have it, this is one of the more common patterns when it comes to magic flows, so I'm pretty confident that I know where it goes from here. I'll give it a try, and you can correct my movements if I'm too far off-course. Here we go!\"\r\n\r\nAfter I manage to cast the spell that Melindra was trying to teach me, we use the same learning method for the next few spells, and it works flawlessly. As I am focusing on learning as many spells as possible in the limited time we have at our disposal, forty minutes pass us by without me even noticing."

            text: "I spend the next few minutes showing Kate the ice spells that I already know how to cast, while she gives me some tips on how to improve my stance and my movements so that I can make the spells more effective. When we're done with the ones that I know, she begins teaching me some new spells, which I immediately recognize as being from one of the intermediate magic manuals that I've read in the past. Her explanations are all clear and to the point, which makes the process of learning a lot faster than I was expecting. I guess I made a good call when I chose her as the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"So, how does it feel?\" Kate says, as she watches me practicing the movements required to shoot an ice beam.\r\n\r\n\"How does what feel?\" I ask her.\r\n\r\n\"Having achieved your lifelong dream in a different plane of existence,\" Kate says.\r\n\r\nI pause from my magic practice for a brief time, to ponder over Kate's words."

            text: "\"It feels... good,\" I tell her, after a while. \"This may not be the first time when I've had the opportunity to cast magic, but it's the first time when I feel like I've actually earned it. At long last, I can say that my long years of relentless study have not been wasted. Even if I'm essentially just using my imagination in a realm governed by our minds, I can't help but feel that this may be one of the most important steps I've taken towards my goal of becoming a mage. For now, let's just say that I'm planning to enjoy these moments for as long as I can!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad,\" Kate says, with a slight smile. \"Now get back to work. Your movements are lacking and your stance is deplorable. You need to work a lot more on your form before you can conjure anything close to the ice beams that you've seen from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" I say, and then I begin my practice again.\r\n\r\nOnce I manage to shoot a beam of ice of acceptable proportions, Kate continues to teach me a few more of her spells, and as I am focusing on the task at hand, forty minutes pass us by without me even noticing."

This catches the attention of Illuna, who now asks her a question.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Illuna says. \"Did something happen in the ether?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah...\" Flower answers Illuna. \"It looks like Peter and the Overseer are both on the move. They haven't run into each other yet, but they probably will soon. Also, Peter seems to have already found the king of the underground's soul, and they're currently travelling together.\"\r\n\r\nAs Illuna and Flower are talking, we can hear some grunts in the background from Daren, who is putting a lot of effort in trying to replicate my spell casting technique, although he's had no success with it so far. My other friends tried it too at first, but they eventually gave up and just decided to enjoy the food and beverage served to them by Flower. At the present time, Flower, Illuna and I are the only ones who seem to be able to cast any sort of spells in this place.\r\n\r\n\"In that case, I don't think we can afford to wait any longer,\" Illuna says. \"If you want to join the battle on the ethereal plane, you should probably do it before it begins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you be coming with us?\" Flower asks."
