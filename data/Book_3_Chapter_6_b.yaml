        text: "As Gontrok gets closer and closer, we all eventually stop talking while a feeling of tenseness and uncertainty gradually begins to fill the air around us. Hadrik is now putting some distance between him and us, in order to make sure that we won't be caught in the crossfire when the two shapeshifted giants begin exchanging blows. The next twenty seconds of waiting feel almost like an eternity. \r\n\r\nWhen Gontrok finally enters our line of sight, Hadrik plants his feet into the ground and he puts his guard up, bracing himself for impact. Without showing any signs of slowing down, Gontrok keeps charging towards us, lining himself up with Hadrik until he arrives about two dozen feet in front of him. He then suddenly accelerates, travelling the remaining distance between the two of them in the blink of an eye, while readying his fist to strike as hard as he can.\r\n\r\nHadrik blocks the punch with both his forearms, but the impact of the hit is still strong enough to send him flying a few feet backwards. When he sees his enemy successfully landing on his feet after the first attack, Gontrok stops to give Hadrik a malicious grin before he begins to talk.\r\n\r\n\"I've been looking forward to this!\" Gontrok says. \"I hope you're ready for our rematch, Hadrik.\""

I recognize that goblin!\" Gontrok says, as he points towards Kelrim. \"I've seen him with the rebels. And if you people are travelling with him now, then that means...\"\r\n\r\nAs Gontrok figures out what's going on, his face gradually lights up with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Hah! I knew it!\" he says in a loud voice, making sure that we can all hear him properly. \"You were hiding under the city this whole time, weren't you? That's why we couldn't find you! You were being sheltered by the so-called 'king of the underground' and his merry men. Iâ€™ve been telling the real king for a long time that these underground dwellers were traitors and needed to be eliminated, but the captain would always find a way to defend his old disciple and to claim that this underground society somehow didn't pose a threat to us. Oh, I can't wait to see how he'll defend them now!\""

First the rebels and now you. It's clear that this king of the underground is working against the best interests of Ollendor, and I'll make sure that he gets punished for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Gontrok,\" Hadrik says. \"Do you really think you have the luxury to talk to other people after you challenged me to a battle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be serious,\" Gontrok says. \"You know full well that I'm only toying with you.

This was a good surprise attack, I'll grant you that. So, what are you planning to do now?

I was beginning to worry that all those years you've spent masquerading as a dwarf had turned you soft. Now I can tell your parents that their pathetic son has at least not completely lost his honor. Not that they would care much, of course. Most of the times when I talk to them about you, they like to pretend that you don't even exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut your mouth and continue the fight, Gontrok--\" Hadrik says, but he is interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Was it worth it, Hadrik?!\" Gontrok shouts loudly, in order to drown out Hadrik's voice. \"Was it worth it to leave your homeland behind, along with all of your friends and family, just because of what happened to an insignificant dwarf village?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dwarf,\" Arraka says. \"I swear... if I see you losing your cool again over this...\"\r\n\r\n\"I get it,\" Hadrik tells her in a calm tone, even though it's clear that he is barely able to contain his anger."

Did you think that you'd somehow make things right after killing all those dwarf women and children by going to put flowers on their graves or something? Face it, Hadrik, you are a murderer, like the rest of us. The only difference between you and me is that I am not an honorless dog like you, and I can live with killing a few civilians during a war without turning into a complete coward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dwarf,\" Arraka says. \"If you let him get under your skin again, I swear I am going to rip out your spine and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I get it!\" Hadrik shouts loudly, as he rushes furiously towards Gontrok.\r\n\r\nWhen Gontrok tries to block his opponent's first hit, Hadrik shapeshifts himself into the size of a leprechaun, sliding between Gontrok's legs and arriving behind him. Then, he almost instantly turns back into human size, grabbing Gontrok's head from behind and pushing it hard into the ground. As he is now holding Gontrok's head against the pavement with his left hand, Hadrik goes for the finishing blow, attempting to punch him as hard as he can with his right fist in the back of the head."

Gontrok takes advantage of the confusion Hadrik is in to escape his grasp and to jump backwards, and once he is safely out of his old friend's reach he begins staring at a narrow alleyway to our right, with a reproachful look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Your help was unnecessary, captain,\" Gontrok says.\r\n\r\n\"Was it, really?\" we hear the voice of the captain of the guards, as he is now slowly revealing himself. \"It most certainly didn't look like you had things under control from where I was standing, recruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been watching us this whole time?\" Gontrok says.\r\n\r\n\"I've been watching enough of this fight to know that you're out of your league, Gontrok,\" the captain says. \"I did not want to interrupt you at first, because you tend to react badly when people interfere with your duels, but after seeing your abysmal performance just now, I've concluded that I've already let you waste enough of my time as it is. Get out of the way, Gontrok. The rest of us will take it from here.\"\r\n\r\nAs Gontrok looks like he is simply boiling with rage, the other royal guards are now approaching us one by one, from every direction."

If my spell is to have any effect on them, they'd need to get immobilized first, somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could try and freeze all the enemies around us, but you'd have to huddle up closer so that I don't freeze any of you by accident,\" Kate whispers.\r\n\r\n\"Pssst, Hadrik!\" I say in a low voice. \"Hadrik, can you hear me?... Damn it, he's not looking at us!\""

Maybe he's in one of the shops and he'll get here as soon as he's finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop lying to yourself, Gontrok,\" the elf says. \"It's clear that your friend betrayed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you just say to me?...\" Gontrok says, as he gives the elf a menacing look.\r\n\r\n\"Hadrik!\" Kate says as loud as she can while still keeping her voice low enough to not draw attention to herself from the others.\r\n\r\nAs Hadrik finally turns to look in our direction, Kate signals him to come closer to us through a hand gesture, and when he understands what she means, the dwarf begins to approach us with small steps, in order to not distract our enemies while they are still arguing."

Why aren't you killing them?! Stop talking and kill them now! Do you hear me?! Kill them now!!!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hadrik gets close enough to our group, Kate sends a quick wave of freezing magic all around us, targeting all of the enemies in our vicinity. The royal guard with the pointy ears manages to conjure a wind barrier in time, defending himself from the attack. The captain hardens his aura in the form of a semi-transparent shield, which keeps both him and the ambassador from freezing. Two of the other guards are not fast enough to react, however.\r\n\r\nThe wave of freezing magic catches Gontrok and a royal guard wearing a red cape and a hood completely by surprise, turning them both into statues of ice. Illuna does not miss this opportunity and she immediately conjures three huge flying water serpents, just like yesterday, each of them going after their own target. The first serpent goes after Gontrok and the other royal guard who was frozen."

The elf air elementalist appears to have created a small but very powerful tornado in front of him, which is making short work of Illuna's water construct, despite its large size. In a different part of the battlefield, it looks like the captain of the guards transformed a part of his aura into some kind of invisible sword, because he is acting as if he were holding a weapon by the hilt with both hands, while cutting the water serpent in half.\r\n\r\n\"Stay behind me, ambassador,\" the captain says, as he is still cutting through the large serpent. \"I'll make sure that nothing happens to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" Illuna tells us. \"The ambassador is their weak link.

Not long afterwards, the elf loses the strength from his legs and he falls flat on the ground, with nothing left to do but to slowly bleed out and die.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know that the hydra wouldn't attack you?\" Daren asks Leila, as the creature made of air is now fading away.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't,\" Leila writes, as she is now coming back, \"but the elf wasn't paying attention to us when the hydra appeared, and he didn't do any gestures that would make me believe he was the one who cast that spell, so I figured that the chances were high for this to be simply an illusion made by some other mage to scare us away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicely done!\" I say. \"And that was a nice assist from you too, Overseer.

It appears that the hydra is not planning to follow us, but it also won't let us get anywhere near the elf. Now that the elf is safe from our attacks, he decides to resume his previous tactic of throwing wind blades at us until he hits someone. While I am dodging again in mid-air, Daren calls out to me from below.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, Leila, come hide inside my barrier for now,\" he says. \"There's no use tiring yourselves out like that until we make another plan of attack.\"\r\n\r\nLeila and I both graciously accept Daren's offer and after evading a few more of the elf's attacks, we manage to move inside Daren's barrier safely."

No, I'm definitely not imagining it. The number of rocks has almost doubled since the last time I looked at the sky. Does this mean that this bastard has just been making boulders all this time while the rest of us were busy fighting below? I suppose that would explain why he hasn't bothered to attack us again after that one time at the beginning. He must still be preparing his ammunition.\r\n\r\nWhen I get close to the rocks, I slow down my speed and I fly into their midst, in the hopes that I will find the earth elementalist who made them somewhere nearby.\r\n\r\nOh, boy... there sure are a lot of boulders here, aren't there? I wonder what would happen if I were to kill the earth elementalist who created them while the boulders are still floating in the sky. They probably won't be kind enough to just remain in the air, will they?... Then again, if I don't deal with the elementalist, he'll just keep making more of these rocks, and then he'll send them towards the ground at an even higher speed than if they were to simply fall."

That should normally give my friends enough time to defend themselves from the falling rocks in one way or another.\r\n\r\nWhile I am navigating carefully between the boulders, I can't help but notice that the Overseer's green-eyed drone is still following closely behind me. Does he seriously still think I'm going to answer that survey or is he just messing with me?... I guess it doesn't really matter either way. At this rate, that drone is probably just going to crash into one of these rocks and then I won't have to worry about it anymore."

He's clearly hiding his aura, but I can sense it if I concentrate on it really hard. What I'm not getting is why I can't see him. I'm looking in his direction right now, but all I'm seeing is a huge rock. Is he hiding behind the rock?... No! Within! He is hiding within the rock. That's got to be it!\r\n\r\nAs I am having my revelation, two large rocks are coming at me from opposite sides, at high speed, trying to crush my head between them. I easily dodge them and then I head towards the big boulder in which the elementalist is currently hiding. Seeing that I'm flying straight for him with my dagger ready, the elementalist immediately moves his big boulder out of the way, and then all of a sudden half of the rocks that were immobile only a second ago are flying out of the elementalist's path to make way for him to pass, while the other half are trying to kill me."

Your dome may well become our last line of defense soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" Kate says. \"I will focus all of my efforts on defense, then. Let's hope we won't come to regret this decision later.\"\r\n\r\nShe then begins to pour as much magical energy into her ice dome as she can, making it a lot more opaque in the process. It is harder now to see what is going on outside our shelter, but once Daren's barrier fails and the boulders start hitting the ice dome we can easily tell exactly what's happening."

        text: "The rocks just keep coming one after the other, but Kate's reinforced ice is still holding strong. We can almost sense the earth elementalist's frustration, as he keeps hitting the dome across its whole surface, trying to find any kind of weak point. He even sends ten consecutive boulders in the exact same spot once, in the hopes that Kate won't be able to recreate and reinforce the ice fast enough to block them. In the end, none of his tactics work and although Kate's dome looks as if it were ready to crumble any minute, the rocks from the sky are no longer falling, presumably because after all this time the earth elementalist finally ran out of ammo.\r\n\r\nJust as we are about to relax a little, the ice dome above us gets destroyed completely and then we feel the captain's aura pushing us into the ground with a greater force than ever before."

The elf somehow manages to block the incoming attack with a wind barrier, and then he makes a small tornado between him and Daren in order to prevent him from going forward. What Daren does instead is to put his sword into the whirlwind, which to our shock makes it become smaller and smaller until it turns into this small spinning gray wind that keeps rotating around Daren's blade.\r\n\r\n\"What?!\" the elf shouts. \"No! No, this is just ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so surprised?\" Daren says. \"No matter how fast you spin it, an element is still an element. As long as the tornado is small enough, I can still absorb it. Here, you can have it back.\""

Before he gets to react, Daren sticks his sword through his heart, killing the man almost immediately.

Flower, on the other hand seems to have been a little more careful with her energy spending, because her magic is just as strong as it was in the beginning."

The elf makes a wind barrier to defend himself, and when he realizes that there is nothing more he can do he quickly casts some air currents around himself, similar to the ones that Melindra always casts on me, and he flies away in order to avoid getting burned to death by the fire wyvern.\r\n\r\nWhile I am watching him fly, I quickly realize that this guy barely has any control over his air currents, unlike Melindra or me, because he is moving through the air in a completely chaotic way, as if he were being carried away by a strong wind or something. He must have been really desperate if he still decided to try flying even under these conditions."

How did you know exactly when to call us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't,\" Rose says. \"I actually called Barry a little earlier, because I wanted to tell him that I could probably still use my time-freezing power once more for the day in case you guys needed it. But before I got the chance to say anything, I realized from the noises that you were all in the middle of a battle, so I decided that I should just wait for the right opportunity to help, instead of calling out to you and making you lose your focus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, your intervention couldn't have been timed any better,\" Daren says. \"We may well have all died without your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your friend on the transceiver...\" Kelrim says. \"She froze the time? Is that why you were able to cancel the captain's aura technique all of a sudden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's right, you were also frozen by Rose's spell so you couldn't tell what was happening,\" Daren says. \"Yes, Rose froze the time for a while, and that gave me the opportunity to-- Kelrim, are you alright?... Your face looks really pale! I mean... at least I think it's pale. It's not normal for it to be such a light shade of green, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine...\" Kelrim says. \"It's just... it's just that... if your friend hadn't intervened, I would have most likely cast that nausea spell that I told you about before on the captain. I may have been only seconds away from ending my own life, and the thought of that terrifies me a little.\""

Thank you. Shall we teleport back to the base?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd say it's about time, yes,\" Albert says, as he finally cancels his invisibility spell and reveals himself to now be standing right next to us.\r\n\r\n\"Nice timing, Albert!\" I say. \"You sure were a lot of help back there, when we most needed you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare me your sarcasm,\" Albert says. \"I said that I'd help you and I did. I killed the black-robed royal guard, didn't I? Surely, you weren't expecting me to kill all of the guards myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but it sure would have been nice if you had at least tried to attack the captain while he was crushing us to death,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"The captain had a keen enough magical sense that I couldn't get anywhere near him without being detected,\" Albert says. \"Trust me, if that weren't the case, I would have assassinated him a long time ago.

            text: "\"Great,\" I say. \"Now let's get back there before-- ah crap. Watch out for falling drones!\"\r\n\r\nTwo more drones fall from the sky and land near our position, as we all run back to our initial spot. In the meantime, Kate conjures an ice wall behind us and Daren once again makes a semi-transparent barrier with his shield. The drones explode a little quicker this time and the flames melt through the ice wall, but the obstacle placed by Kate is still enough to stop them from reaching Daren's shield. As we manage to climb down the crater and to get back to our original location successfully, I look at the sky one more time to confirm my suspicions.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the Overseer is indeed still unable to move his drones. All he can do is drop them on us and use them like bombs. His timing with the detonation has gotten a little better on his second attempt, but it doesn't matter. The only drone that was directly above this area was the one he used to attack us at the beginning. There are no more weapons for him to use against us. For now, we should be safe.\r\n\r\n\"Make sure that you don't leave this area,\" I tell everyone. \"There are no drones directly on top of us, so the Overseer won't have any bombs to use against us here.\""

We are all in his debt...\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" the teleporter guy says, as he looks away, towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I will take Kelrim back to the waiting room,\" Albert says, as he approaches Daren. \"There are many people that would like to say their goodbyes to him, especially in the quarantine area.\"\r\n\r\n\"...Make sure that he gets a proper burial,\" Daren says, as he hands Kelrim's body to Albert somewhat hesitantly.\r\n\r\n\"We will do what we can,\" Albert says, and then he takes the goblin in his arms. \"Now if you'll please excuse me, I need to go report the death of the captain of the guards to our king.
