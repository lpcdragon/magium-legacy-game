Deitrah... Dengah...\"\r\n\r\n\"A Dedra stone,\" Flower and I say at the same time, without thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a Dedra stone!\" Eiden says, looking both surprised and impressed by our answer. \r\n\r\nHe then takes a look towards me and Flower, and then another look towards Kate, who had been watching his every move and was readying a few icicles ever since he began walking closer to Melindra.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations, Melindra,\" Eiden says. \"It looks like you've made some good friends while I was away!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take the stone,\" Melindra says, as she quickly grabs the rock from his hand, while looking slightly embarrassed, \"and I'll consider it as a form of apology, but don't think that you're off the hook just yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" Eiden says, with his usual polite smile."

Wasn't there supposed to be a white mage in your group? Whatever happened to Daren? You know... dark-skinned fellow... very tall... wears armor all the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm right here, jackass,\" Daren says. \"Don't act like you don't see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good sir, you must be mistaken,\" Eiden tells him. \"Aside from your obvious lack of heavy armor, the Daren that I know would have tried to kill me with the first opportunity, or at the very least, he would have looked at me as if he were ready to slit my throat at any given moment. I do not remember having had any other conversations with you since the last time I saw you, so what has changed, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, you don't remember...\" Daren says, in a thoughtful voice. \"You would have no way of remembering, in fact...\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" Eiden says.\r\n\r\n\"Let's just say that a... different version of yourself from another world has given me a helping hand when I was at my lowest point,\" Daren says, \"and because of that, I am willing to take a somewhat more lenient attitude towards you, at least for the time being.\"\r\n\r\n\"...You are talking about the God of Time's trials?\" Eiden asks, in a more serious tone than usual.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Daren answers, simply."

        text: "\"I see,\" Eiden says, as he spends a few seconds in quiet contemplation before he speaks again. \"In that case, I should probably give you a warning. This may sound obvious to you, but that Eiden and I are not the same person. We do not share the same memories, and based on how old that version of me was, he may have had a completely different outlook on life than the one I have now. I do not know what he's said to you, or how far you've been sent into the past, but you should not make the mistake of thinking that anything you've discussed in that trial applies to this world. Believing otherwise will likely only set you up for disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Daren says. \"I'm not planning to make that mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" Eiden says. \"Now that we've got that settled, perhaps it is time to change the topic of conversation to one of the two main subjects that I've come here to talk to you about. First of all, let us discuss Ollendor. Tell me, Barry, what do you think about their new king?\""

In order to counteract this, the king of the underground had his men spread rumors for a day or two, making sure that the majority of the population would find out for themselves about the state of the prisoners and about the horrors that they have endured all this time at the hands of the previous king and his underlings. As a result, people very quickly took to the streets in order to request that all the prisoners should be freed at once, and naturally the goblin was very happy to comply with their demands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I get it!\" I say. \"And since the people themselves were the ones who asked for the prisoners' release, they could no longer complain about the flying vehicles no longer working, right?\""

The truth of the matter is that I was getting bored waiting for you all to reach your next destination, and I came here in the hopes that I could perhaps ask you to hurry it up a bit, since your next encounter very much concerns me as much as you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Kate says. \"Why would our next destination concern both you and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"...You mean you don't know where you're going?\" Eiden asks, looking rather shocked.\r\n\r\nHe then turns towards Melindra, who is looking very stressed out right now."

After I found out, I thought that I could keep this a secret and meet with Meridith myself to get the pinecone detector, but she wouldn't have it. She kept questioning me on the transceiver about what I needed the device for, and who I was travelling with, and when I gave her the name of Daren, she somehow immediately made the connection that you would be in the same group, and asked to meet you, specifically. She said that unless you personally came to request the pinecone detector from her, she would never give it to me. Kate, I know how this sounds, but I promise I can fix this! I KNOW I can fix this somehow! I just need a little more time!\"\r\n\r\nDuring Melindra's speech, there was an ever-growing murmur in the background, from Daren, Hadrik, Illuna and Flower talking to each other in a worried tone, while Arraka was laughing hysterically from within her amulet. As I was trying to figure out my own feelings on the matter, I suddenly noticed that Eiden had been smirking at me this entire time, with his eyes closed, as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you glad, Barry?\" Eiden tells me, once he sees me looking at him. \"Now you'll finally get the chance to deliver my message!\"\r\n\r\nThat's right... Eiden's message. I had completely forgotten about it, with everything that's been going on lately. Does this mean that he still wants me to deliver it to the lessathi after all this time?"

Can you do that for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can do that!\" Melindra says, and then she starts taking deep breaths, one after the other, even though it is obvious that she is forcing herself to do it and that she is not relaxing at all. \"Okay, what next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I want you to listen closely to what I'm about to say,\" Kate says. \"It is not a problem for me to meet with Meridith personally. You can go ahead and arrange the meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not?\" Melindra asks, looking very confused. \"I can?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Kate says. \"Perhaps a little more than a week ago I would have said something different, but while I was in the first trial of the God of Time's ritual, I received a lot of help from Meridith. In fact, without Meridith's help, I would have almost certainly ended up dead. As things stand, I feel like I at least owe her the benefit of the doubt, considering that my good friend Diane also told me herself that she was working with Meridith of her own free will. \"\r\n\r\n\"So... I can call Meridith?\" Melindra says. \"Can I tell her that we'll meet her whenever she wants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can,\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"Wow... this is... I can't tell you how much of a relief this is!\" Melindra says. \"I thought for sure that you would try to kill me if I told you this.

She doesn't look older than nine, or maybe ten at most!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's because her soul has been fused with a banshee, named Illuna,\" I say. \"They now share the same body and they both live together inside Flower's mind on the ethereal plane, where they eat cookies and drink tea every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"A banshee...\" Diane says. \"I suppose that would explain why her aura felt so different, but to share the same body and even live inside the same mind?... I would have never thought that such a thing would be possible...\"\r\n\r\n\"So, umm, sorry to interrupt,\" Hadrik says, \"but is this where we are supposed to be teleported from, or do we need to go somewhere else?\""

I've found Leila! We've been travelling together!\"\r\n\r\n\"Leila?...\" Diane says, looking as if she were having a hard time remembering who that was. \"Oh, the mute girl with silver hair who escaped with the caretaker. She was still alive? Good for her!\"\r\n\r\n\"She has a way to talk now,\" Kate says. \"She uses a device that reads her thoughts and puts them into floating letters, forming words, so that we can all read them. We became very good friends. I'll make sure to introduce her to you some day. I'm sure you'll love her!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I will,\" Diane says.\r\n\r\nOn our way to our destination, Kate continues to talk with Diane for a few more minutes, during which she tries to summarize as much as she can about what she has done since she was sent away from Varathia, and about what has happened to us during the tournament.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrive at the point of teleportation, Diane grabs her transceiver and she calls the person in charge of handling the teleporting device. Once they are done with their conversation, Diane asks us one last time if we are okay with this, and then she gives the lessathi the signal to transport us to their lair."

I offer this to you as an apology for all the suffering that my people have caused you in the past. I realize that it won't make up for all those agonizing years spent in the Beacon, but at the very least it should serve as a--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sacrilege!!!\" shouts the lessathi who is operating the teleporter. \"This is unheard of! Unimaginable! Do you think that the holy scepter of Heldenbusorag is some cheap souvenir that you can just give out to random visitors? How dare you mock our heritage in such a way!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not mocking anyone,\" Meridith says, calmly. \"The importance that this relic has to our people is exactly what gives it value as an apology. There would be no point in giving it to her otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I-- I can't accept this!\" Kate says, as she takes a step back. \"If it's so important to you, then you should keep it.\""

For a mage like yourself, it should greatly help with focusing your energy during attacks. Give it a try.\"\r\n\r\n\"...Alright,\" Kate says, hesitantly, as she holds the scepter forward, and she shoots an icicle into one of the walls.\r\n\r\nThe icicle easily penetrates the thick seredium wall, and it goes all the way through, making a deep hole inside it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll admit that I wasn't expecting it to work so well,\" Kate says, in an impressed tone. \"Normally, it would have taken me a lot more time to magically sharpen and reinforce an icicle to such a degree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to know that it works well for you,\" Meridith says.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that the Heksol faction will be quite displeased with your actions, Lady Meridith,\" says the lessathi teleporting engineer, who seems to have calmed down a little since his last outburst. \"I will tell them about this matter, personally.\""

And even if they had doubts on whether I would go through with it or not, they will surely find out that I was being serious when they will see the scepter in Kate's hands. Times are changing, Grihirt. You and your faction will just need to accept this. Heksol has been dead for years, and yet you still name your group after him. At some point, you will have to accept reality for what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will see about that,\" Grihirt says, in an acid tone.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go,\" Meridith tells us. \"It is a long way from here to our main base of operations, so we should be on our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Daren says, as we begin to follow her through the dark tunnels lit by torches, while leaving the disgruntled lessathi behind.\r\n\r\n\"I realize that I may have been a little unreasonable when I asked you to come here if you wanted the pinecone detector,\" Meridith says, while we are walking behind her, \"but I promise you that you will not regret your decision. I may not be able to erase what the lessathi have done to you in the past, but I am most certainly going to make them compensate you a hundredfold for your troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you going so far out of your way to help us?\" Illuna says. \"I thought that tournament organizers were supposed to remain neutral towards the participants.\""

Therefore, I intend to pay that debt to her in small installments whenever I get the opportunity. If there is anything that you need.... anything at all, please do not hesitate to ask me, and I will do my best to accommodate your wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't recall having introduced myself,\" Illuna says. \"Could I be so bold as to inquire how you knew my name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the leader of the lessathi,\" Meridith says. \"I make it one of my top priorities to know as much as possible about what happens in Varathia. You two have made quite a name for yourselves in the past twenty years, and it is also rumored that you have the golden fox's protection. It is only natural that I would at least know who you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\nMeridith now pokes one of the seredium walls a few times with a small metal rod, and a secret door opens up, allowing us to go into a hidden tunnel."

They only work for half-lessathi. That is actually the main reason why the two stats were even locked, since half-lessathi were seen as inferior, and could not be allowed to wield such power. My guess is that these stats have not been removed entirely from the devices because the lessathi from six or seven hundred years ago who created them were likely still hoping to find a way around this problem, up until the moment when they were all nearly annihilated during the still winter. At any rate, even if I do unlock these stats for you, you won't be able to use them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, I'm a half-lessathi, not a regular one,\" I say. \"I already tested those stats during Emergency Mode, so I know that they work for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a half-lessathi?...\" Meridith says. \"No, that can't be right. Romantic relationships between lessathi and humans are strictly prohibited by our community. And besides, if you came here as a tournament participant, it must mean that you were living somewhere outside Varathia. This means that you or your parents must have somehow--\""

Shortly upon contact with me, the tip of the rod begins to glow with a bright green light, while Meridith just stares at it, in complete silence.\r\n\r\n\"Our auras match...\" Meridith says, as she still seems to be recovering from the shock of what she's just seen. \r\n\r\n\"And what does that mean?\" I ask her.\r\n\r\n\"It means that we are related by blood,\" Meridith says."

They would need to be at least a hundred times stronger for something like that to work!\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred times stronger, you say?...\" Meridith asks, looking as if she were actually seriously considering Arraka's suggestion. \"I think that might be doable. We're probably going to have to recycle some of the bracelets and combine their parts together, but at least our scouts will be safer than they are now. I will tell our tinkerers to start working on this as soon as I return to our base.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, good luck with that,\" Arraka says, in a sarcastic tone."

Those were the three words that I have been avoiding to say all this time, because they would have divulged the true nature of the Magium. And since you two are still here and have not been erased from before our eyes, then this confirms that we should be able to speak freely of this subject matter from now on, as long as we are not standing right next to a Magium node and as long as we are not in the middle of one of Selkram's rituals. Still, I can't believe it took you THIS long to figure it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the behavior of these Magium fragments,\" Daren says. \"I sort of get why they're not attacking us now, because we're out of their reach, but if one of their main purposes is to keep people from finding out what the Magium's true nature is, then why were you allowed to leave earlier?

This fragment's goal seems to be to ensure that the time weaver's prophecy does not get fulfilled. Since it can't get directly involved in a world without 'undoing it from its seams' like the fragment possessing the Overseer tried to do, the fragment we spoke to is trying to guide people from this world to do its bidding. On the other hand, the fragment that tried to erase me back during Selkram's ritual was probably a different entity whose only purpose was to deal with anyone that tried to reveal the Magium's true nature, while in the Magium's immediate vicinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, the fragment that we spoke to doesn't know that you were trying to reveal the Magium's nature, then?\" Hadrik asks.\r\n\r\n\"Considering that the fragments don't usually communicate with each other, the answer is probably 'no',\" Arraka says. \"Which means that the only reason why it tried to send us to the void was because it wanted to punish us for not making any effort to deal with the prophecy. This is already the third Magium fragment we've met that tried to end our existence in one way or another. Call me crazy, here, but I'm starting to think that our individual lives don't have much value to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fragment said it itself,\" Daren says. \"A single sacrifice is sometimes required in order for many lives to be saved.

Please understand that you are by no means obligated to give me an answer and I apologize if I am being too direct, but is there any chance that you could tell me what you have discussed with our Creator after you were summoned to his realm?\"\r\n\r\nMy friends and I exchange a look, and after a few moments of silence, Daren is the one who answers Meridith.\r\n\r\n\"We'd rather not discuss that for now, if you don't mind,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" Meridith says. \"That is completely understandable. There is no need to rush things. If you do feel like talking about it later, let me know!\"\r\n\r\n\"We will,\" Daren says.\r\n\r\n\"Before we take this discussion any further, I would like to ask just one question,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Feel free!\" Meridith says. \"Ask anything you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything I want?\" I say, while raising an eyebrow. \"Alright, then. In that case, could you tell me if you are the one who's been buying up all of the stat devices from the other continents shortly before the beginning of the mage tournament?\""

I can't think of many people who would fit that description.\"\r\n\r\nI then pause for several moments, to see if the expression on Meridith's face changes in any way, but she is able to control herself perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"Is that it?\" Meridith says. \"Are these the only reasons that led you to believe I was the one who amassed all those devices?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I say. \"There's also the fact that my stat booster has been harnessing considerably less energy in Thilias and Ollendor than outside of the two cities. Aside from this, I know of another person with a stat device who's been in Thilias since the beginning of the tournament, and who has gathered far fewer stat points than me because of that. If there were some other harnessers of magical energy in those cities, like for example let's say... a thousand stat devices, then it would make a lot of sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"What exactly are you implying?\" Meridith asks me."

The only reason why you even considered offering it as a prize was because you knew for certain that this was the only thing which could possibly lure so many mages to a single place. The real purpose of this tournament was never to choose a champion to defend Varathia. It was to use all those stat devices that you bought to extract a huge amount of energy from the participants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, now I get it!\" Hadrik says. \"That's why they made us wait for one week before giving us our first objectives. And it's also why they made us run around the whole continent like idiots, looking for pinecones. They were stalling for time so they could get enough energy out of us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" I say. \"Honestly, the only thing I can't figure out for the life of me is why they would even allow the mages to kill each other at all. Why not just make a rule stating that no killing is permitted before the tournament begins, and then delay us indefinitely?\""

            text: "\"That is what we tried initially,\" Meridith says calmly, while we all turn to look at her. \"That is also the reason why most of the energy extractors have been placed below the major cities of Varathia. It's because we expected the majority of the tournament participants to seek shelter inside the cities while they'd wait for the first objectives to be announced. We even went as far as sabotaging the telepathic device meant to relay those objectives to them, just to be sure that we'd have as much time as possible. Unfortunately, the kings of Varathia disagreed with us. They said that enforcing a rule preventing tournament participants from killing each other would be against the 'tradition' of Varathia and that they wouldn't accept it. And to top it all off, they only informed us of this very shortly before the beginning of the contest. You couldn't even begin to imagine just how much this affected our plans...\"\r\n\r\n\"So, you're admitting it, then?...\" Daren says, perplexed. \"Just like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Meridith says, while shrugging. \"Your friends seemed to have most of it figured out, so why prolong the inevitable?\"\r\n\r\nShe pauses."

Ever since the destruction of Olmnar, twenty years ago, the kings of Varathia and the lessathi have been working together for a single, common purpose, and after twenty arduous years, we have finally found a way to achieve it.

That is why I'd like to have you as insurance. Don't worry, I'm not asking you to go on a suicide mission. Even if by some miracle, Eiden manages to survive until the end of the tournament, he will still be in a very weakened state after we're done with him. Weak enough that your group should have no trouble finishing him off. If you agree to provide assistance to us in such a scenario, I will personally grant you unlimited access to the Magium node that we visited together earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just to be clear, you don't have any intention of actually revealing your secret plans to us, do you?\" Daren asks.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" Meridith says. \"If by any chance, Eiden were to capture you and extract this information from you in some way, all of our efforts will have been in vain.

This means that you will need to keep participating in the contest and to complete your objectives, unless you want to risk being kicked out of the continent by the kings. As long as you are willing to make this effort, you deserve to have your prize, no matter what the outcome of our final confrontation with Eiden will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, if we were to agree to help you, the kings would not know about our arrangement?\" Kate asks.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Meridith says. \"This deal is only between you and me. The kings do not know that we have a Magium node of our own, so they cannot find out that I'm willing to grant you access to it as a reward for your assistance. In other words, I am making this offer to you as the leader of the lessathi, not as an official organizer of the tournament. Let me repeat myself. All you have to do is continue to participate in the tournament, just like you were doing before, and to assist us against Eiden in the very unlikely scenario that our plan should fail, and you will ALL be granted the prize that you've been seeking this whole time, without even having to win the contest.\""
