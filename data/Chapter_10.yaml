        text: "\"I can't believe that we managed to get ourselves imprisoned twice in two days,\" Hadrik says. \"And by animals and ogres, to boot. If word gets out, we're going to become the laughing stock of the tournament.\"\r\n\r\nIt has now been close to six hours since we were teleported to our prison cell. I can tell because my stats device also shows me the hour of the day, in addition to my stats. Otherwise, it would have been almost impossible to find out how much time had passed, because not only are there no windows in our cell, but also no sources of light whatsoever, except for the small light coming from my stat booster's screen. \r\n\r\nFor the past few hours, we've been trying to shake off the permanent paralysis effect of our prison cell and to come up with a plan to fool the ogre guards into releasing us. So far, we've made no significant progress on either front. Daren and Hadrik managed to remove their paralysis spells temporarily, by focusing all of their magical energy into giving their muscles a powerful jolt, but they were barely able to move three feet before the spell was automatically cast on them once more. \r\n\r\nOf the five of us trapped here, I appear to be the only one that can move my hands, even if only slightly. It turns out that partial resistance to paralysis is one of the perks I get for being a lessathi, along with a higher than average resistance to electricity. That being said, this newfound ability of mine hasn't really helped me much, except for being able to take the stats device out of my pocket in order to use it as a makeshift candle."

        text: "Seeing that we couldn't free ourselves from the paralysis spell, we decided to shift our focus towards engineering a plan to have the ogres open the door and cancel the spell for us. Unfortunately, despite their renowned stupidity, the ogres were under strict orders to not let us go under any circumstances, and they were much too afraid of their captain to risk going against his wishes.\r\n\r\nRose hasn't spoken a single word since we got imprisoned. Illuna's betrayal must have really affected her. The rest of us aren't exactly in the best of moods either, but we are far from having given up. Since the ogres are afraid of letting us die of starvation because of our collars, we are expecting them to come bring us food, sooner or later. \r\n\r\nAt the moment they open the door, Daren and Hadrik will use their muscle jolt techniques and make a run for it, in the short time they have at their disposal before they get paralyzed again. They will then find the control panel that cancels the paralysis spell, and we'll all be free to roam their stronghold at our leisure. It's not a perfect plan, but it's better than to just roll over and accept our fates.\r\n  \r\n\"That accursed banshee!\" Daren says. \"I knew from the beginning that she was plotting something. We were so heavily underequipped for this mission that I had no choice but to accept Flower's help when she offered it, but now I'm starting to regret that I didn't listen to my instincts instead.\""

I'm busting you out. Now come on, we shouldn't be lingering too much time in one place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not buying it,\" Daren says. \"I'm much more inclined to believe that your deal with the ogres didn't work out as well as you were hoping, and now you're trying to use us to get back at them. The proof is that you didn't tell us about your plan beforehand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't tell you beforehand, you oaf,\" Illuna says. \"Your reactions needed to be genuine when I betrayed you. The shaman can tell from your auras if you are actually shocked or just pretending. That is the reason why I had to put Flower to sleep. As a banshee, I am the only one who the shaman can't read, because I am in complete control of my emotions, as well as my aura fluctuations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Daren says. \"Well, why don't you wake the girl up, then, so she can confirm all of this herself?\"\r\n\r\n \"The stasis I put Flower in cannot be undone forcefully without risking serious complications,\" Illuna says. \"The spell usually lasts two days, so I didn't have the time to wait for her to wake up before coming to rescue you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How convenient,\" Daren says.\r\n\r\nThe banshee frowns at him.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't feel like breaking out of this cell, then I'll just take the others with me, and leave you here to rot,\" she says."

That would be a bit problematic for me.\"\r\n\r\nShe then gestures with her right hand towards us, and my dagger and crossbow get thrown in my lap, while at the same time, Kate's dagger gets thrown into her right hand. The banshee then grabs Daren's sword, and she eyes him intently. Daren tries to get up, but the effect of the paralysis still hasn't completely worn off, so he staggers on his feet. After looking at him for a few seconds, Illuna decides to throw his sword to me instead.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you take it,\" the banshee tells me. \"You seem to have a decent head on your shoulders and you know him better than I do. I'll let you decide whether to give him the sword or not, given the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry...\" Daren says, as he gets up and starts walking towards me. \"Give me the sword.\"\r\n\r\nHe's got that look in his eyes again.

The rest of us follow them out of our cell, to get a better view of the fight. So far, nobody seems keen on stopping either of them.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to settle this once and for all,\" Daren says, with a serious tone in his voice. \"We fight to the very end.

The water solidifies as it reaches him, and the impact of the hit makes him unclench his fist and sends the sword flying out of his hand. The banshee then immediately makes another whip with her right hand, which quickly coils itself around Daren's waist, as it turns itself solid as well. Before Daren has the time to figure out what happened, Illuna pulls on the whip and she flings him with full force into a wall. When he tries to get back up, the banshee creates a water spear out of thin air and she points it at his neck. Despite it being made of water, the spear's tip looks sharper than regular steel. It must be the result of a technique similar to Kate's ice reinforcement.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand...\" Daren says. \"How did you manage to throw me like that? It makes no sense!\""

The whip did so by itself, and I just mimicked the motion with my arm to make it appear like I was the one doing all the legwork. Since you didn't expect a mere child to have so much strength, you left your guard down against such attacks, thus becoming vulnerable.\"\r\n\r\nShe pauses.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" she continues. \"I don't usually do this kind of thing, but if you promise to stop being an idiot, I am willing to spare your life for Flower's sake. Actually, I think I've worded that wrong. It may well be physically impossible for you to stop being an idiot. Just promise that you won't attack me again, and I'll give you back your sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're willing to let me live after all of this?\" Daren asks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Illuna says. \"If legends are anything to go by, then you are the kind of man that would rather die than break his word. If I can get you to swear it, then I will at least rest assured that you won't try anything until we get out of the fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll swear it,\" Daren says. \"I won't lay a hand on you until we get out of the fort.\"\r\n\r\nThe banshee frowns again.\r\n\r\n\"Fair enough,\" she says, as her water spear disappears into thin air."

I spent years of my life teaching them everything I knew. I taught them how to defend themselves from banshee hunters and white mages. I taught them how to tell when their bodies were starting to reject them, so that they could start looking for new hosts in good time. In other words, I taught them how to survive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was awfully nice of you...\" Kate says, with a frigid tone in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"I know, right?\" Arraka says. \"It was all a sham, of course! To tell you the truth, I was starting to get a little bored with the small amount of suffering I could bring to the world while trapped in weak animal bodies. So this time I decided to try something a little different! I spent years of my life, making myself into this sort of motherly figure for the three young banshees, all in order to make it more painful for them when I inevitably betrayed them. But as time passed, my original perspective began to change. As I got to know the three banshees better, I started to grow fond of Illuna. She was my star pupil after all, and she reminded me a bit of myself when I was her age. So instead of simply having her killed along with the others, I decided to instead shape her in my own image.\""

If we follow this path right here, we should be able to make it all the way to the lowest level of the main building, where their treasury is being located.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" Hadrik says. \"Before we get going, I think there's still one more issue that needs to be cleared up. The shaman called you Illuna of the sacred woods massacre earlier, and he said that you killed hundreds of animals without mercy. What was that all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can answer this question for her!\" Arraka says.\r\n\r\n\"Arraka, I swear, if you don't shut up...\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"Hmm?\" Arraka says. \"You'll what?\"\r\n\r\nIlluna doesn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I thought!\" Arraka says. \"So anyway, as I was saying, in order to better understand the events of the sacred woods massacre, I need to tell you a little story first. It is a story about three young banshees that I decided to take under my wing out of the kindness of my heart a few hundred years ago. Their names were Sidara, Unuri and Illuna.\""

        text: "\"Wait, you used to be Illuna's guardian?\" Hadrik asks.\r\n\r\n\"No, I used to be her mentor,\" Arraka says. \"I was the one being that she looked up to the most. I remember the three of them once saying that they wanted to be like me when they grew up! That was before they knew who I really was, of course. I spent years of my life teaching them everything I knew. I taught them how to defend themselves from banshee hunters and white mages. I taught them how to tell when their bodies were starting to reject them, so that they could start looking for new hosts in good time. In other words, I taught them how to survive.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was awfully nice of you...\" Kate says, with a frigid tone in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"I know, right?\" Arraka says. \"It was all a sham, of course! To tell you the truth, I was starting to get a little bored with the small amount of suffering I could bring to the world while trapped in weak animal bodies. So this time I decided to try something a little different! I spent years of my life, making myself into this sort of motherly figure for the three young banshees, all in order to make it more painful for them when I inevitably betrayed them. But as time passed, my original perspective began to change. As I got to know the three banshees better, I started to grow fond of Illuna. She was my star pupil after all, and she reminded me a bit of myself when I was her age. So instead of simply having her killed along with the others, I decided to instead shape her in my own image.\""

I made sure that she knew all kinds of obscure techniques and that she could control her water element to perfection. Then, when the time came, I led them all into one of the sacred woods. It was easy to get them to follow me. They all trusted me with their lives, and they didn't know that I was taking them into forbidden territory. Poor Unuri and Sidara were no match for the valiant guardians of the forest, and Illuna was not strong enough to fight all of the animals by herself while also protecting her friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arraka, I'm warning you!\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, and Illuna was simply adorable!\" Arraka says. \"Did I tell you? Back then she absolutely refused to kill other living creatures unless she had no other choice. She would be depressed for days after changing hosts, because she'd been forced to end someone's life without their consent! Needless to say, even in a dire situation such as this, Illuna still refused to kill the animals, and simply incapacitated them. I know this, because I was watching the whole thing from above, while laughing continuously. They didn't understand what I was doing at first. They kept calling for me, begging me to save them like I always did. They saw all of the events unfold before their eyes, but their minds simply couldn't comprehend them. It was only when Unuri and Sidara got impaled that the cold hard reality finally hit Illuna in the face.\""

So, in a fit of rage, Illuna exterminated every single one of those guardians, leaving no survivors, and then she hurried over to her friends' side, grabbing their lifeless bodies and shaking them desperately, as if she were expecting them to suddenly come back to life. 'Please!' she said. 'Don't leave me,' she said. 'I don't-- I don't want to be alone--' AHA- AHAHAHAHAHAHA--\"\r\n\r\nIlluna closed the amulet and gripped it firmly in her fist. I could see her hand shaking as she held onto the amulet, and I think I could almost hear a small crack coming from it. Just as Arraka warned her, the hologram of the fort disappeared almost as soon as she closed the locket. \r\n\r\n\"Bring it back,\" Illuna says, curtly, as she opens the amulet again.\r\n\r\n\"Hmm?\" Arraka says. \"Bring what back? Oh, you mean the hologram? The hologram's gone. Didn't you see it go poof? I'll need hours to recreate it again. You should have listened to me when you had the chance, but nooooo, you just had to be your old stubborn self again and-- \"\r\n\r\n\"I said bring it back!\" Illuna shouts at her."

I don't know how that girl puts up with you!\"\r\n\r\nIlluna ignores Arraka, and she turns to Hadrik.\r\n\r\n\"I trust that Arraka's explanation about the sacred woods massacre will suffice?\" she asks him, with a dark look on her face. \"Or would you perhaps like to hear more details?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, no...\" Hadrik says. \"I think I'm good, thanks...\"\r\n\r\nIlluna then turns around and starts leading us to the lower levels, as we all follow her, in silence. Thanks to Arraka's map, we were able to successfully avoid most of the guards as we made our way towards the treasure room. The ones that we couldn't avoid were quickly and silently dispatched by Illuna. Her way of doing things was completely opposite to Flower's. She was cold and calculated, and she would use the girl's athletic prowess to her advantage when going in for the kill. Every time she had to take out an ogre guard, she'd climb one of the walls, position herself above him and then hang from the ceiling to deliver the finishing blow."

If only I had my enchanted backpack with me now, I would have filled it to the brim with treasure. Still, there's plenty of room in my pockets for me to stash a few of these small expensive gems. The diamonds in particular should fetch me a hefty sum in any respectable market. After all, when will I ever get another chance like this?"

Just stay where you are!\"\r\n\r\nThe two of them hesitate for a second, but after looking me in the eye, they both decide to trust my judgment and stay behind with me.\r\n\r\n\"Seriously?\" Illuna says, as the ogre captain smashes his club into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe floor starts to shatter, but as I predicted, the cracks in the ground stop forming right in front of us. It turns out that we were standing above one of the underground cave's walls, just like Hadrik and the ogre captain. Illuna reacts quickly by jumping on a wall, and using it to propel herself to our position before the floor crumbles beneath her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you know,\" she says. \"You were actually right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daren!\" Rose shouts, while looking down inside the chasm that had formed in the middle of the room."

        text: "Looking inside the pit, I see that Daren is hanging from a wooden beam which is beginning to crack under his weight. I had completely forgotten that he got thrown into a wall at the beginning of the fight. He must have still been in a dazed state when the floor started crumbling. As I look below to see if there are any footholds I could use to get to him, I realize that even if I managed to somehow reach his position, there's just no way that I could climb back up. The wooden scaffolding is practically unusable at this point. All that's left of it are some support pillars and a few beams here and there that look like they could break any second.\r\n\r\n\"Stay where you are!\" Daren shouts at us. \"Whatever you do, don't come down here! Don't worry, I have everything under control!\"\r\n\r\nHe's lying. At most, he's got half a minute before that beam breaks under his weight, and he has no way of climbing back up. He must be trying to protect us.\r\n\r\n\"You bastard!\" Hadrik shouts at the ogre captain, as he clashes with him once again. \"You were the one who told the ogres that the middle of the room was a safe area, weren't you? Were those soldiers' lives worth nothing to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah!\" the captain says. \"Those weren't my finest warriors. They were just cannon fodder. All of them replaceable. I alone strong enough to deal with the lot of you. Look below! One of your friends already at end of his rope. The rest of you are going follow him soon.\""

        text: "The beam that Daren is holding onto cracks loudly. He doesn't have much time left. Completely out of the blue, Illuna jumps past us and into the pit. She uses one of the wooden pillars to propel herself back towards the cave's wall, which she then uses to push herself further down into the pit, and back towards the wooden pillar. She jumps back and forth between the pillar and the wall a few times, until she finally reaches Daren's level. She then grabs the cave's wall with her left hand, and she extends her right hand towards Daren.\r\n\r\n\"Healer, grab my hand!\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"Like hell, I will!\" Daren says.\r\n\r\nThe wooden beam cracks again. This time it looks like it's about to break.\r\n\r\n\"Healer, there's no time!\" Illuna shouts. \"Grab my damn hand!\"\r\n\r\nDaren looks at her hesitantly for a few seconds, but he doesn't get the time to think on it any further, because the wooden beam finally cracks under his weight, and he starts falling into the chasm. Illuna pushes herself into the wall with all her strength and jumps towards Daren, grabbing him with her right hand. As the two of them fall into the pit, they start shining brightly, and right before they reach the ground, they disappear and then reappear on the floor in front of us, safe and sound.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" the ogre captain shouts, as he tries to smash Hadrik with his club again."

You should be glad that you've been granted the opportunity to finish us all with your own hands!\"\r\n\r\n\"Illuna, can't you help him?\" Rose asks. \"I don't know how much longer Hadrik can keep this up...\"\r\n\r\n\"The ogre is wearing anti-magic armor from head to toe,\" Illuna says. \"This means that I can't make my water sharp against him, so my whips and my arrows are out of the question. Normally, I'd use one of my whips to pull him into the chasm, but he's just too big and heavy for me to move with the amount of magical energy I have at my disposal. My stronger spells would probably penetrate his defenses, but they aren't designed to hit a single target, so I'd risk hitting the dwarf along with the ogre captain if I used them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be something we can do...\" Rose says. \r\n\r\n\"Hey, dwarf!\" Arraka shouts loudly. \"Remember how I told you that the ogres' weak spot is at the base of their necks? It's time for you to put that secret technique I taught you to good use!\"\r\n\r\nHadrik laughs.\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" he says, grinning widely. \"I suppose it's time for me to stop fooling around!\""

Hadrik focuses all of his aura in his right fist, and he punches a hole through the ogre's chest armor, making the captain fall on his knees, drop his club, and start coughing up blood. Hadrik seizes the opportunity, grabs the ogre's club and throws it inside the chasm.\r\n\r\n\"Why?!\" the ogre asks, as he coughs up more blood. \"Why did go for chest instead of neck?! Wasn't secret technique supposed to aimed for weak point?\"\r\n\r\nHadrik and Arraka both start laughing simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"There was no secret technique, you moron!\" Arraka says. \"I only said that to make you panic and focus all of your defense on a single point.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess it only took two of us to defeat you after all,\" Hadrik says, grinning. \"Maybe you should have brought some real soldiers with you, instead of small fries.\"\r\n\r\n\"This not over yet, dwarf,\" the ogre says, and he coughs some more. \"I'm going to crush your puny head, and--\"\r\n\r\nHadrik doesn't let the ogre finish his threat, and he crushes his head between his hands. As the ogre's lifeless body drops to the ground, the dwarf jumps over to our side of the room, and grins at Arraka.\r\n\r\n\"That wasn't half bad for a spirit of joy and laughter,\" he tells her. \"You've certainly earned your quota for the day for making me laugh to my heart's content.\""

Aha- AHAHAHAHAHA!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you gone out of your mind, banshee?!\" Daren shouts, furiously, all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n\"Who, me?\" Arraka asks.\r\n\r\n\"Not you!\" Daren says. \"The other banshee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, because I teleported you out of the pit?\" Illuna says. \"You're not seriously going to start claiming that you could have gotten out of there by yourself, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not!\" Daren says. \"I was about to die, and then you saved me! Why would you save me? My death would have benefited you in every way, and no one could have blamed you if you left me to die! What could you possibly have hoped to achieve from this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason to justify my actions to you,\" Illuna says. \"Figure it out yourself.\"\r\n\r\nDaren's face is so red with anger that he looks like he might explode any second."

What's that decoy that you left behind with your own magic signature, anyway? A clone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the shaman says. \"It's one of my followers, holding an artifact that copies my aura.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fascinating,\" Arraka says, as she changes the original green dot's color into blue.\r\n\r\n\"How did you find out where we were?\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"The captain and I had a telepathic link, which was meant to warn me once he left the realm of the living,\" the shaman says. \"You're going to pay for this, you little traitor. My followers are going to turn you all into ashes.\"\r\n\r\nHe then raises his staff in the air, and the five other ogres step in front of him, casting fireballs in unison at us. Hadrik and Daren both step in front as well, in order to form our first line of defense. The dwarf focuses his aura in his fists, and he sends two of the fireballs right back at the ogres. Daren places his sword in front of him, absorbing the other three fireballs within it. He then slashes his flaming sword towards the ogres, and sends a powerful fire beam at them, which burns them into a crisp."

As the fog clears a bit, I realize that we are no longer standing in the middle of a cavern, but on an open plain, and it appears to be... snowing?\r\n\r\nMy eyes are not deceiving me. It really is snowing. There's a thick layer of snow on the ground, and the trees I see in the distance are all covered in snow as well. Could this be an illusion?     \r\n\r\n\"Damn it!\" Arraka says. \"I completely lost track of him. He went invisible again, and I can't sense his aura at all. Actually, I can't feel any of your auras either. What the hell?\"\r\n\r\n\"You aren't the only one,\" Kate says. \"I've completely lost my magical sense as well. Could this have anything to do with the fog?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Illuna says. \"This is a shaman ritual. Basically, it's a very advanced mind affecting spell. We're not in the real world anymore, and thus, there are different rules. We're not missing only our magical senses, but also our magical powers. You were already wearing collars, so you can't tell the difference, but Arraka and I cannot cast any spells at this moment. Also, it would appear that ranged weapons are not allowed either, since Barry's crossbow is gone. I think magical items are still functional, though, since the shaman must have used his staff in order to turn invisible.\""

When they come out of the woods, we learn that they are in fact wolves, though they are at least three times the size of normal ones, and their fur is as black as coal.\r\n\r\nFive of them start running towards our group, while Daren and Hadrik step in front of us and assume their battle stances. Three of the wolves go right for them, but the other two circle around and go for Kate and Illuna instead. Daren defended himself with his shield from one wolf, while he sliced the other's head clean off. Hadrik punched the third wolf in its mouth and sent three of its fangs flying, as the animal squealed in pain.\r\n\r\nKate was waiting for the beast with her dagger in hand. The animal dashed towards her, but she managed to get behind it in the blink of an eye, and she slit its throat with a single motion, as her hands got drenched in the wolf's blood. The look in her eyes changed completely when she started fighting the wolf. She's always had a sort of feral look about her, but this was more than that. This wasn't her just being ruthless or efficient. Those were the eyes of a beast hunting its prey. This must be why she was able to survive alone in a jungle at the age of twelve, before she even had any magic. In order to avoid being hunted, she was forced to become the hunter instead."

They also seem to have just woken up, because they are now looking around themselves to confirm that we are indeed back in the abandoned mines below the ogre fort."

The shaman grins maliciously at me, and then he starts charging up his staff again. \r\n\r\nHe clearly thinks that I can't get through his barrier without using magic. I wonder why that is? I've studied many books about barriers in my life and this one definitely doesn't look like it's impervious to physical attacks. In any case, I don't have the time to think this through. I'll use my full strength and try to get past his barrier before he finishes charging up his staff.\r\n\r\nI raise my arm and I put as much force behind my blow as I possibly can. When my dagger hits the barrier, I start feeling a strong vibration, and after a few seconds, my hand gets repelled with a force similar to the one behind my strike. My dagger flies from my hand, and before I have the time to go back and get it, the shaman finishes charging up his staff, while his whole barrier explodes outwards, with a powerful wave of light, obliterating anything in its path. The last thing I got to see before I died was the light enveloping me, as I felt the flesh and meat being burned off my bones."

Go, go, go!\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf dashes towards the forest, and within moments he disappears behind the trees. Meanwhile, the wolves seem to have gotten bolder, because they are now starting to come out of the woods in greater numbers than before. After advancing slowly and carefully for a while, all of the wolves suddenly start running towards us at the same time, as if they'd received a signal to attack. \r\n\r\nThe battle begins quickly, and Daren kills three of the wolves with a single slash of his sword. Four of the other wolves have already started chasing Illuna, who is avoiding them to the best of her ability. As the fight goes on, I notice that Rose is being surprisingly calm, given the situation. She makes sure that she is always in Daren's range, so that he can defend her, but at the same time she tries to stay out of his way as much as possible. \r\n\r\nI can't just stand around and do nothing. I pull out my dagger and jump at one of the wolves, trying to stick my knife in its throat."

You only need a little guidance to learn the basics. For instance, a good starting point would be to practice calming the flow of your aura first. Here, let me show you how it's done.\"\r\n\r\nIlluna spent the next two hours teaching Kate how to suppress her aura, step by step, while we kept marching towards the ruins. By the time she was done, I could see that they'd made enormous progress. Kate's magical aura was barely noticeable when she suppressed it now, and you could very well confuse her with a normal human if you didn't examine her closely. The lessons Illuna provided were interesting enough that even Hadrik and I joined in mid-way, and we both spent more than half an hour doing various exercises suggested by her to help us hide our auras from enemies."

It also doesn't help when some smartass giant decides to go on a rampage in the middle of dwarven territory, just to satisfy his inferiority complex. Most of these troublemakers have been dealt with by our own warriors, but they usually get to do a lot of damage before they're caught, and it's not like the lives they've taken can just be brought back again.\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses a bit to take a drink from his bottle.\r\n\r\n\"But enough about politics,\" he says. \"We should be discussing more important matters. Like for example, what's going on between you and Rose? Is it just me, or have you two been getting a little closer in these past two days?\""

        text: "Once we put some good distance between ourselves and the edge of the forbidden forest, we decided to set up camp near a small river, in an area without many trees. Flower, who had recently woken up from her stasis, was now being filled in on the details of what had happened since she'd been put to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad that Petal's plan worked out in the end!\" Flower says, after she hears the whole story. \"I got a little worried when she told me that she needed to put me in a stasis for two days, but I decided to trust her judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, did you just say Petal's plan?\" Kate asks. \"Didn't you say before that both of you worked on this plan?\" \r\n\r\n\"Well...\" Flower says, feeling a little embarrassed. \"The truth is that Petal is the one who usually makes all of our strategies. I just follow her lead most of the time... At first, I didn't think she would help out this time around, since she was always making sure to keep her distance and not get involved with you guys. But then something happened that made her change her mind in that night before we reached the fort. She wouldn't tell me what happened, exactly, but all of a sudden she'd become so much more active in planning the whole operation, and she even took care to minimize the risks to your safety! I don't know what got into her, but I'm really glad that things turned out the way they did!\"\r\n\r\nRose smiles at me. I think we both know what made Illuna change her mind before we reached the ogres. It seems that our discussion in private with her during her night shift had a lot more of an impact than we'd originally thought."

Since the girl had magical energy to spare after her long nap, she offered to conjure for each of us a dish of our own choosing. I wasn't particularly hungry, so I just asked for some lemon cakes. Everyone else went all out, however, and asked for the most extravagant dishes that came to their minds, like manticore ribs seasoned with a variety of spices, or griffin wings coated with honey. Everyone except Kate, that is. Given that she hadn't really had the luxury of ever tasting any food other than the one she'd hunted herself, she simply asked for roasted duck legs and she went to eat by herself on a log a few dozen feet away from our camp.  \r\n\r\nAfter eating my fill of lemon cakes, I went over to Kate's side, to see how she was doing. I caught her staring blankly at one of the trees in front of her, and she didn't even notice me until I placed myself right in front of her.\r\n\r\n\"Still thinking about Diane?\" I ask her.\r\n\r\nKate looked a bit taken aback by my straightforwardness, but in the end she decided to answer me honestly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes...\" she says. \"She's been on my mind ever since I woke up in those ruins, but I've been trying my best to not let it show, given the situation we were in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" I tell her. \"Have some lemon cakes.

That, however, still does not excuse her behavior and the way she put us all in even greater danger through her actions. She's always been like this.

I realize that it is way beyond late now, but I couldn't just let things go on like this forever. The reason why I came here to you tonight is that I wanted to... apologize.\"\r\n\r\nIt looked like it took every ounce of his strength to utter that last word. I don't think I've seen him this tense even when we were battling the hydra in the lessathi ruins.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that?\" Kate says. \"You'll have to repeat that last word you said, because I could barely hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, woman!\" Daren says. \"You know very well what I said. Don't make me repeat it! Now, do you accept my apology or not?!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after Daren finishes his sentence, Kate starts to laugh. But her laughter is sounding much more natural than ever before. When he first heard her, Daren looked as if he were about to blow his fuse again, but then he realized that there was no hint of malice in Kate's laughter, so he eventually calmed down."

I was being honest when I said that I never noticed you ignoring me all this time. The two of us never really talked all that much, so none of this seemed strange to me. But I really appreciate you coming out to me like this. Thank you! This made me feel a lot better!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiles.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure what this is all about,\" we hear Hadrik's voice coming from behind Daren, \"but I'm willing to bet that this would be the best moment to finally hold that victory celebration!\"\r\n\r\nHe then places five bottles of dwarven ale on the ground and grins at us."

For those few hours while we drank together, it felt hard to believe that we'd been risking our lives fighting ogres just one day prior. It almost felt like I was back at home, spending a night out in a tavern with some friends, far away from all the madness of this tournament. It was nice to have a night like this for a change. And who knows? Maybe the worst is all behind us, and every night from now on will be like this as well. A man is allowed to dream, right?\r\n\r\nWith these final thoughts, I put my head on the pillow, and I awoke the next morning, feeling completely refreshed. This time around I got the lucky draw, and I didn't need to take any shifts, which was a nice change of pace from all the sleepless nights I've been having lately. Since we didn't have a fixed time limit anymore, we all decided to sleep in today, so it was already ten o'clock in the morning by the time I got out of my tent. Taking a look around the camp, it seemed that everyone else had already gotten up for some time, and they were just about to finish their breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"He awakens at last!\" Daren says, as he sees me get out of my tent. \"Did you enjoy your ten hours of uninterrupted sleep, Barry? It's too bad you missed breakfast, though. Flower really outdid herself this time, too! Her food making skills are simply divine. But don't worry, I'm sure we can still scrounge up some cold leftovers for you to eat if you're really hungry!\""

After she conjures my food, she hands me the plate with an excited look on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Ta-daaa!\" she says. \"A traditional dish from your homeland! Quail eggs with ham and Bagelberry cheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually... this isn't really a traditional meal in the Western Continent,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"It's not?\" Flower says, disappointed. \"Awww, but I was sure I read about this somewhere in a book detailing the Western culture...\" \r\n\r\n\"No, this isn't anything traditional,\" I say. \"It's a select meal eaten by only a handful of nobles in a few of the rich cities on our continent. Which makes it even better! Thanks a bunch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you like it!\" Flower says, smiling. \"I've still got a lot of magical energy left so don't hesitate to ask for seconds if you want!\""

What if I told you that I am deeply unsatisfied with this group's abysmal kill per hour ratio and that I'd only consider continuing our collaboration if you promise to work on improving it, huh? What then?\"\r\n\r\nWe all stare at Arraka's amulet for a few seconds, until Hadrik decides to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Alright, then!\" he says. \"It's time for us to start dismantling our tents. Meet you all back here in thirty minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" Arraka says, as we all start heading towards our tents. \"HEY! Don't you dare ignore me! Do you hear me? Come back here! I'm not done complaining yet!\"\r\n\r\nIt took me a while, but after I got done with my tent and my backpack, I headed back towards our meeting spot, where everyone except Kate seemed to have already arrived. As I got closer, I saw that Flower was currently spinning Arraka's amulet by the chain with a displeased expression on her face."

She didn't have any problems like this when she was possessing animal bodies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh good, Kate's here,\" Daren says, as he sees Kate approaching us. \"I guess we should be good to go, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we headed, exactly?\" Hadrik asks.\r\n\r\n\"The city of Thilias,\" Rose says. \"It's a small harbor town near the southern coast.

I forgot to wash the plates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who cares about the plates?\" Daren asks. \"Can't you just conjure new ones out of nowhere like you do with the food?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but it would be a waste to just leave them here,\" Flower says. \"They sell for a pretty good price on the market. This won't take long, I promise. I'll just pick them up quick and wash them in the river. I'll be right back!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, I've always wondered about something,\" Hadrik tells Daren, as Flower rushes past him. \"If they call you guys white mages, then shouldn't necromancers be called black mages? You know, to keep the theme going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, that's a common misconception,\" Daren says. \"This has nothing to do with warriors of the light fighting the forces of darkness. The only reason why white mages are called like that is because of the bright light that appears when they cast most of their spells. It's not really an official name, but I guess it kind of stuck. Some white mages with a stick up their arse sometimes even get offended when they're called like that, and they--\"\r\n\r\nDaren stopped talking, because a familiar figure had just appeared out of thin air in front of him. A boy with his eyes closed, his hands in his pockets and a polite smile on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, friends!\" Eiden says. \"I come bearing news!\""

With enough practice, you will see that each person's aura is unique, and it can be used to track them down from a great distance, if your magical sense is sharp enough. Mine happens to cover the whole island of Varathia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say that you can find out any person's whereabouts at any given time?\" I say."

Besides that, you can also find out their age, their race and their mental state. If you tamper with a person's aura enough, you can even stop them from aging! Speaking of auras, Barry, I happened to see your aura in very close proximity to two lessathi a few days ago. Did you remember to give them my message?\"\r\n\r\nCrap, he's talking about the two lessathi that were with Diane. His stupid message was the last thing on my mind at the time.

This can't be happening... We were finally rid of the collars. We were rid of them! Everything was going to be okay. Why did you have to come back? Why?!\r\n\r\n\"Time is running out, Barry,\" Eiden says. \"Your friend is at the end of her rope. How are you going to stop me?\"\r\n\r\nHow AM I going to stop him? I still have no idea how he powered up my stat device when I fought the dragon, and I don't know any of his weaknesses. Does he even have weaknesses? Are there any words that can get me out of this like last time? What would make him let her go? What would convince him to let this slide? What am I supposed to do?!\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, there's a loud noise of plates shattering to our right, and Rose finally manages to take a deep long breath, as both Eiden and I turn to identify the source of the sound.\r\n\r\nFlower is just standing there, with an expression of pure shock on her face, and with a dozen shattered plates lying at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it isn't Illuna, of the sacred woods massacre!\" Eiden says, smiling. \"It's been twenty years, I believe?

Flower then shoots a beam of fire that engulfs Eiden completely, but it simply passes him by and leaves him unharmed. \r\n\r\n\"You killed them!\" Flower says. \"You killed them all! Bring them back! Do you hear me?! Bring them back!\"\r\n\r\nShe then conjures a dragon made entirely of fire that flies towards Eiden and starts to attack him with its claws. Flower also joins the battle up close, and she tries to punch the stillwater with her flaming fists.\r\n\r\n\"Illuna,\" Eiden says, as he parries the girl's strikes with one hand, and the dragon's with the other. \"Do you think you can put a stop to this? I'm kind of starting to lose my patience, here...\"\r\n\r\nFor a second, the girl's eyes turned bright blue, and I could clearly see the fear in them. The next moment, Flower stopped moving, and she looked as if she were being held against her will by an invisible force.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go, Petal!\" the girl says, as tears start to form in her eyes while she struggles to break free. \"Let me go! I have to kill him! I have to!\"\r\n\r\nAfter trying in vain to free herself for a few more seconds, Flower then turns towards us."
