My knees still hurt like hell. I've barely even budged from my original position to avoid more pain. Eiden sure did a number on me. \r\n\r\n\"Barry! What happened?!\" Daren says when he sees me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not much. Just a little parting gift from our mutual friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eiden!\" says Daren, while clenching his fist.\r\n\r\nHe casts a healing spell on me and I suddenly get enveloped in a warm, soothing light. The pain leaves me completely, and I manage to get back on my feet with no difficulty. I always knew there were healing spells like this, but witnessing one of them first hand is something else. Most healers I've met in my lifetime could barely even heal light bruises or ankle sprains."

But how did I end up unconscious on the ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you don't remember? He just waved his hand casually and put you to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?... That can't be right. I have so much protection against sleep spells that I should be almost immune. At the very least I should be able to keep my consciousness! And what was that about him using fire magic?

They're goblins, alright. Vile and hideous creatures, not taller than four feet, with fangs instead of teeth, crooked noses, pointy ears and green skin. Despite their appearances, goblins are quite intelligent and are usually organized in clans with clearly defined hierarchies, unlike most other monster races. They're also smart enough to make and use tools, as well as weapons and armor."

That skill was taught to them by the Creator, and they taught it to their disciples, as well as they could. But those that could pick up the skill were very rare and talented individuals.

He and the spirit protector of all animals, the great golden fox decided together six hundred years ago to end all war and hunger, uniting the human and animal kingdom, and leading them into an age of peace and prosperity. They taught both humans and animals how to create what they needed with magic, and thus eliminated the need for work and conflict. Food, water, warmth, shelter, every one of those things could be obtained through magical means. From what I hear, it must have been paradise.\""

        text: "\"How did the Creator live so long? From what you're telling us, he must have lived at least a few hundred years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That is one of the reasons why there are more and more people that don't even believe in his existence anymore. It's already been a long time since he disappeared, and he didn't really show himself to many people before, either. It was mostly only members of the royal families that got to see him. There are many that say that the Creator was simply an invention of the kings, and that they're using his disappearance as an excuse, in order to keep the power to create food for themselves. In some of the cities, these groups of people have started rebelling against their kingdoms, and are on the brink of civil wars.\" \r\n\r\nShe pauses.\r\n\r\n\"But I must be boring you with these stories. I thank you all again from the bottom of my heart for rescuing me back there. I only wish there was something I could offer you in return.\"\r\n\r\nDaren grins.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'll have time to think about that on your way home, because we're coming with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?!\" says Kate."

Didn't you say yourself that you don't have any specific leads to the whereabouts of the friend you're looking for right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... suppose, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's settled!\" says Daren enthusiastically. \r\n\r\n\"No!\" Kate says. \"Nothing's settled! I never said I agree with this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, listen to me,\" Rose interrupts. \"Daren, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I do not want you to fight your friends over it. Trust me, I'll be fine. I know I may have seemed like I didn't know what I was doing back there, but in reality I've walked these roads by myself before. I've purposefully avoided all areas that are frequented by monsters or bandits, and have done plenty of research ahead of time. The only reason I ran into those goblins was because they were a rogue group, far away from any other goblin encampments. It won't happen again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet for a second,\" Kate says. \"Do you hear that?\""

Suddenly the music stops, just as the whistlers get in visual range of us. There's three of them. Weapon enchanters by the looks of them. They seem cleaner than Cutthroat Dave's group, and they don't smell like them, but other than that, they don't look much different. They'll probably attack us on sight like all the others.\r\n\r\nAnd here I thought we'd filled our quota of pointless fights for today. \r\n\r\n\"Clive, do you see that?\" says one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"By the gods, it's a banshee,\" says another.\r\n\r\nThe third man starts screaming, and falls on his back.\r\n\r\n\"Monster! Kill the monster!\" yells one of them, with sheer terror in his voice.\r\n\r\nKate doesn't seem to be taking this very well. She is looking towards the ground, but this time it's not anger I see in her eyes. If I were to guess, I'd say she's feeling miserable.\r\n\r\nThe man named Clive is now rushing and screaming towards Kate, with the sword in his hand, ready to run her through. Daren readies his own sword, but before he gets to act, it is Rose that puts herself between Kate and the attacking mage."

We'll be a lot safer inside a town than out here in the wilderness. Wouldn't it be better to wait somewhere safe until we get our objectives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Finding a city is one thing, escorting a local to one is another. Rescuing her from goblins might not be interpreted as interfering with local affairs, but becoming her personal bodyguards threads dangerously close to 'outside interference' territory.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll just say we needed a guide. Relax, we'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I agree with Barry,\" Kate says. \"We shouldn't be wasting our time on escorting locals.

I won't let you. I owe her for saving my life. And you can't hurt me either. I am a citizen of Varathia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! You think their dumb rules can stop me? I've murdered people before. I'll teach you a little trick: as long as they don't catch you in the act, they have no real proof. What, you don't really believe in their fairy tales about their spell somehow teleporting me away before I kill you, do you? Anyone smarter than a rat would be able to tell that's just a bluff.\"\r\n\r\nHe's right. Even for magic, a spell like the one Varathia's claimed to have cast on us would go much beyond what we know is possible. To stop an attack before it even occurs, you would need something akin to... thought reading.\r\n\r\n\"Clive,\" one of the other men says. \"Maybe you should let her be. We shouldn't be going around attacking locals on our second day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't be attacking her,\" Clive says with a wicked grin. \"I'm just going to teach this little whore her place!\""

        text: "\"No!\" Daren shouts, as he runs towards Rose.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Kate extends her arm towards Clive, and an ice cone is slowly coming out of her palm.\r\n\r\nClive quickly slashes his knife at Rose's face, and she instinctively closes her eyes. The mage stops his strike mere inches away from his target, and his whole body starts vibrating loudly, as it gets enveloped in a white light.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, shi--\" he starts to say, but he gets teleported out of the continent, and away from the tournament.   \r\n\r\n \"What did you do to Clive, you filthy-- YYARGHH\"\r\n\r\nThe man who started to talk was immediately interrupted by one of Kate's cones of ice that went through his right shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Normally, I wouldn't think twice about killing scum like you,\" Kate says. \"But I'd rather spare Rose from witnessing a gruesome bloodbath. So I'm offering you a chance to retreat. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the ice cone in his right shoulder is grinding his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Forget the banshee,\" he says to his comrade. \"Let's get the hell out of here!\"\r\n\r\nOnce the two of them get far enough away, Kate turns to Rose and says:\r\n\r\n\"I've changed my mind. I would be honored to serve as your escort until you reach your hometown. I'm sorry for having misjudged you. What you just did was very brave and heroic.\""
