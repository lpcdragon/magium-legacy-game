Then one night...\"\r\n\r\nI start getting flashbacks of the night when my sister turned into a banshee.

Only it wasn't my sister anymore. Everything was different about her, even her magical aura. She was just about to kill my younger brother, when I picked a pitchfork from the ground, and impaled her with it. I was lucky. The banshee had just awakened, which made her vulnerable. If I had arrived even a few minutes later, I don't think anyone would have been able to stop her anymore.\"\r\n\r\nI pause, and then look Kate straight in the eye."

His defensive barrier seems to be holding up a lot better than it usually does against normal weapons. None of Kate's ice swords are getting through it, even though she's attacking him from all directions.\r\n\r\nDaren is now raising his sword into the air,  and moving it in a steady circular motion. As his sword moves, I can see the air starting to spin around it at great speed. Once he stops rotating his sword, he slashes powerfully towards Kate, generating a strong gust of wind that blows her off her ice platform.\r\n\r\nShe manages to quickly conjure an improvised slide of ice below her and immediately after she lands on the ground, she turns towards Daren with her palms pointing at him. A beam of ice shoots from her hands and heads straight for Daren, who is now holding his sword in front of him. The beam hits his sword head on, but instead of getting frozen, the weapon absorbs the energy from the attack and starts radiating a cold magical aura."

She manages to get out of its way in the nick of time and attempts to retaliate, but Daren, who had already reached her, slashes his sword at her left ankle, making her drop to one knee. She tries to attack him with a beam again, but all she manages to do is point her palms at him, while the ice refuses to come out of her hands. The block of ice she trapped me in is also starting to slowly melt away.\r\n\r\n\"No...\" she says in disbelief.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that won't work anymore, Kate,\" Daren says. \"You won't be able to cast any kind of magic for the next thirty minutes. I already told you, I specialize in dealing with elementalists. My shield protects me against most magical attacks, my weapon can absorb the elements, and I have a sword technique that can temporarily sever your link with the magical plane. You never stood a chance to begin with.\"\r\n\r\nKate tries to get up, but she realizes she can't hope to outrun Daren with her wounded leg. Defeated, she does not say another word and she bows her head, looking at the ground as would a convicted murderer while awaiting their execution."

As we walk, Kate is holding my left arm with both her hands, in order to keep herself from falling again. She does not say a word to me while we distance ourselves from Daren, but she is holding my arm very tightly, even though she hasn't tripped once since we started walking. \r\n\r\nOnce we've put enough distance between ourselves and Daren, I help Kate lay down with her back against an oak tree, and she simply stares at the ground, still not saying anything."

They took in children from all over the continent and offered them shelter and free meals. I was born in Varathia, and abandoned as a child, so I was sent there at a very young age. The institution was run by a handful of very influential lessathi at the time, who had deep ties with the Varathian royalty. Unfortunately, the true purpose of that orphanage was not to shelter children who had no home, but to exploit them because they had no family members left to ask about them. Through repeated experimentation, the lessathi were trying to find a way to turn regular humans into mages.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what you're saying is that you got your powers as a result of these experiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did... Although, the methods they used had an extremely low chance of success. Forcefully injecting magical circuits into a human body is not only a very risky procedure, but also... particularly painful. Of the thousands of orphans that were detained in that institution, only a handful of us survived. Due to the lack of results on their part, the lessathi eventually stopped receiving funds for their project from the royalty, and they were forced to shut down the Beacon.\""

They had no need for rejects, so they just dumped us on other continents.

        text: "\"Can you first tell me who these lessathi are, exactly? My understanding was that they were some ancient race from this continent that went extinct a long time ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes and no. They are indeed the oldest race on this continent, which is why most people refer to them as simply 'the ancients'. However, even though their civilization fell hundreds of years ago, there are still small groups of lessathi here and there, staying hidden and trying to influence events from the shadows. As far as I know, there are no records explaining the exact reason of their civilization's fall, but it is commonly believed that their own arrogance was somehow the source of their undoing. Their banner is after all a hawk holding the sun in its talons, where the hawk represents the lessathi, and the sun represents the gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, I recognize that banner description. You're telling me that Eiden wants me to transmit his message to the remnants of some long forgotten race?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is what I'm saying. I have no idea where he knows these people from or what the meaning of his message is, however. I was under the impression that most people do not know the lessathi even exist anymore. They are very secretive, and also very isolated from all other races. They have their own villages, hidden from the rest of the world, and they are only allowed to marry other lessathi. This is why I'm very surprised you are unaware of your own heritage.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, if the ancients are hidden from most of the world, how come you know so much about them?\"\r\n\r\nKate pauses."

        text: "\"Do you remember how Eiden said I was a survivor from the Beacon of Hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. You never did tell me what it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Beacon was... an orphanage, of sorts. They took in children from all over the continent and offered them shelter and free meals. I was born in Varathia, and abandoned as a child, so I was sent there at a very young age. The institution was run by a handful of very influential lessathi at the time, who had deep ties with the Varathian royalty. Unfortunately, the true purpose of that orphanage was not to shelter children who had no home, but to exploit them because they had no family members left to ask about them. Through repeated experimentation, the lessathi were trying to find a way to turn regular humans into mages.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what you're saying is that you got your powers as a result of these experiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did... Although, the methods they used had an extremely low chance of success. Forcefully injecting magical circuits into a human body is not only a very risky procedure, but also... particularly painful. Of the thousands of orphans that were detained in that institution, only a handful of us survived. Due to the lack of results on their part, the lessathi eventually stopped receiving funds for their project from the royalty, and they were forced to shut down the Beacon.\""

Their prolonged experiments had somehow failed to kill me, but my magic was so weak at the time that I could barely conjure a snowflake. They had no need for rejects, so they just dumped us on other continents. They used their teleportation magic to transport each of us in various remote jungles across the world, with nothing to our names other than the clothes on our backs, and some knives they gave us to fend for ourselves.

The giant man is dressed in leather armor, he has a black beard that reaches down to his chest, and he has a big grin on his face. As he starts to speak, his voice is so loud that it completely drowns out any other sounds in a five mile radius. It doesn't really help that he's shouting either.\r\n\r\n\"Now that I have everyone's attention,\" the giant man says. \"I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Hadrik, but my friends call me 'the dwarf'. I came to this tournament for only one reason: to test my strength against the strongest mages in the world! So, what do you all say?! Shall we have a fun little practice bout before we get our objectives? I'll be waiting right here for any challengers! I'll try to hold back as much as I can, but I can't make any promises. Ahahahahahahahaha!\"\r\n\r\nHis laugh is loud and jolly, kind of like the laughter you hear from friendly bartenders and innkeepers. What's wrong with this guy? Doesn't he realize what kind of place this is?\r\n\r\nThe giant starts to shrink slowly as he's laughing, and eventually he disappears behind the trees."

        text: "\"Damn!\" Daren says. \"That is some impressive shapeshifting. He must have a lot of magical power to be able to turn into something this big!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have no knowledge of even the basics of shapeshifting magic?\" Kate asks him. \"You can't just turn into something ten times bigger than your normal size, no matter how powerful you are. It violates the fundamental principles of shapeshifting. This was obviously an illusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah? Since you're so sure it was an illusion, could you perhaps care to explain how he managed to make such a realistic earth tremor while he was busy maintaining the illusion spell?\"\r\n\r\n\"How am I supposed to know that? Maybe he has an ally that specializes in earth magic. How is that even relevant?\"\r\n\r\nSomething isn't right here. Although the fundamental principles Kate speaks of should indeed prohibit the use of shapeshifting in such a manner, an illusion isn't that much more probable either. There's no way any illusion could reach this far out, no matter how powerful the mage is. There must be something we're missing. Or perhaps the man who calls himself Hadrik managed to find a way to temporarily circumvent the laws of magic as we know them?"

        text: "Yes, you can, in theory. There's a kind of magic that helps with surpassing the limitations of the human body while doing physical training. The downside is that unless you have a lifespan of hundreds of years, you'd have to spend most of your life training in order to reach their levels of strength. Could they be using stat devices too?\r\n\r\nThe two contenders are now moving so fast that I can barely follow them anymore. Eiden is landing most of his hits, but the dwarf doesn't seem to be having any trouble tanking them. Hadrik, however, hasn't managed to hit the stillwater once. Whenever it looks like he's got a decent chance, Eiden flows like water and effortlessly gets out of his way, subsequently using the dwarf's momentum against him in order to make him lose balance."

Hell, I'm not even sure if he's being serious right now.\"\r\n\r\nA few more minutes pass, and the fight still doesn't seem to be going anywhere. At least the two combatants seem to be enjoying themselves well enough.\r\n\r\n\"You're all pathetic!\" shouts a mage who is wearing red robes and has a particularly crazy look in his eyes. \"There are dozens of you and you're still scared to take on a single stillwater? Don't tell me you're actually planning to watch the fight until the end?\"\r\n\r\nEiden and Hadrik have now stopped their battle and are both looking at the mage who just spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Calm down, my friend,\" Azarius says. \"He already told us that he's not participating in the tournament. Why should we attack him for no good reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a fool to believe him, old man. A fool and a coward. If you're all too craven to attack him, then I'll do it myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe turns towards Eiden and raises his hands in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Behold, stillwater. Behold, the power of Felran, the strongest fire elementalist on the Eastern Continent!\"\r\n\r\nAs he speaks, there's an enormous spinning column of fire forming around him."

I can't really guarantee you it will be painless, though. YAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\"\r\n\r\nHis laugh is just as crazy as the look in his eyes. Eiden looks at him calmly, with his eyes closed, and he raises an eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"DIE!\" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards the stillwater in the form of a beam. Before the flames reach him, Eiden stretches his right arm in front of him, with his palm facing the elementalist mage. All of the fire stops and gets condensed into a small bright sphere, floating in front of his hand. The sphere then gets sent back towards its original owner, with shocking speed, incinerating the elementalist in an instant. The flames disappear just as fast as they appeared, leaving only a pile of ashes where the proud mage once stood. \r\n\r\n\"Damn! You sure don't pull your punches,\" Hadrik tells the stillwater.\r\n\r\n\"Neither did he, for all the good it did him,\" Eiden says. \r\n\r\nHe then looks towards me, with his eyes still closed and smiles wickedly. Oh no. He must have just realized he also teleported me here along with all the others. What is he plotting this time?\r\n\r\n\"Alright, let's continue, then!\" says the dwarf, grinning."

Kate is wearing her hood and covering herself in her green cloak, in order to hide the fact that she is a woman, while moving very cautiously, to avoid attracting any attention to herself. Before we even take five steps, however, a very loud voice coming from my left pocket drowns out all other noises in the area. \r\n\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? Hello?\" Rose shouts through the transceiver.\r\n\r\nCrap. I had completely forgotten the fact that the device was set at its maximum volume. This is bad. This is really bad. Every single one of the mages is now looking at me, even the two that were about to start fighting.\r\n\r\nI quickly tap the transceiver in order to talk to Rose, but before I get to say anything, it is Eiden that answers her question.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Rose. We can all hear you,\" he says, loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Is that... Is that Eiden?\" Rose asks."

Be careful!\"\r\n\r\nI turn off the transceiver and look all around myself. The mages are still staring at me. This is not going to end well, is it?\r\n\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa... You've got to be kidding me. Another stillwater?\" says one of the mages.\r\n\r\n\"No, this one's just an ordinary human,\" Azarius says. \"You can tell by the look in his eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Eiden asks, smiling. \"Of course he's a stillwater. Didn't you all see him fight that dragon in the sky singlehandedly a few hours ago?\"\r\n\r\nThere's a loud murmur again, as many of the mages confirm having seen me duel the dragon. If I'm going to want to bluff my way through this tournament, then there will never be a better opportunity than this."

There's no way that two of them would show up just like that, after so many decades of absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Eiden says. \"Surely, you must have all seen him battle a dragon in the sky singlehandedly a few hours ago?\"\r\n\r\nThere's a loud murmur again, as many of the mages confirm having seen me duel the dragon. \r\n\r\n\"He speaks the truth,\" I tell them. \"That dragon was in my way, so I had to get rid of him. But you don't need to worry about that. Unless of course you plan to stand in my way as well...\"\r\n\r\nThe mages start talking amongst themselves, but they are hesitating to respond to my provocation."

If you lot are too craven to attack him, then I'll do it myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe mage in red robes steps out of the crowd and takes his battle stance.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will live up to my expectations, stillwater.

At this rate, I'm going to win this tournament well before they announce the first objectives.\"\r\n\r\nHe raises his hands in the air, and an enormous spinning column of fire starts forming around him.\r\n\r\n\"Behold, hero.

Daren does not say anything, but he's watching the fire elementalist intently, with his sword in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"DIE!\" the mage screams, as he sends all of the fire towards us in the form of a beam. Just as the flames reach us, with one quick slash of his sword Daren sends all of the flames back to their owner, incinerating him on the spot and turning him into ashes.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see that?!\" shouts one of the mages. \"His sword absorbed the flames and sent them right back at the other mage.

When I stop right in front of the healer, looking at him with a smile on my face, I can see his sweat dropping from his forehead. Just as I thought. With the exception of Daren, healers are all bark and no bite.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" I ask him. \"Didn't you say that this was the best time to strike? Well, I'm right here. Give it your best shot!\"\r\n\r\nThe blond mage attempts to grab his dagger, but his hand is trembling too much to be able to unsheathe it. I can see the fear in his eyes as he desperately looks around him for some support from his allies, but they're all too scared to say anything.\r\n\r\n\"Y-Y-You're in luck, stillwater!\" he says, finally. \"I've changed my mind. I would much rather fight you on equal terms, after you've fully recovered. I never really liked unfair fights. We'll see you again, soon. Come on, men, we're leaving.\"\r\n\r\nThe white mage heads for the forest, and about ten or so mages are slowly starting to follow in his footsteps.

Weren't you the one who taught me that banshees are foul demons that are not to be trusted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry, I've told you many times before, there is no need to be so formal when you address me. You can call me simply Azarius. As for your question, before I answer you, I must ask you this: Do you remember the first lesson I taught you about banshees? Do you remember why banshees need to possess human or animal bodies in order to survive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! The banshees were originally born on the magical plane of existence, but they were banished long ago and cursed to live the rest of their lives on our earthen plane. On this plane, it is not possible to live for long without a physical body, so the banshees were forced to adapt, by stealing the bodies of other living organisms. Once it is seized by a banshee, the body stops aging, but due to the incompatibility between the banshee's soul and the physical body, the link between the two will decay over time, which forces the spirit to change hosts once every few decades.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good!\" Azarius says. \"Now, tell me, do you sense any kind of other-worldly vibe radiating from this woman's body? Does her magical aura appear in any way to be different from that of any other mage you've encountered in your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but, I do not understand... How can this be?...\""

You can't possibly tell me that you are basing your entire reasoning on something so vague!\"\r\n\r\n\"You surprise me, healer in armor,\" Azarius says, thoughtfully, as he strokes his beard. \"The way you phrased your last sentence suggests that you do not believe this woman to be anything other than a banshee. And yet you seem to travel alongside her. Most peculiar.\"\r\n\r\nDaren is looking a little flustered after hearing the sage's remark, but Azarius pays him no mind and instead steps towards me.\r\n\r\n\"What about you, Barry?\" he asks me. \"From what I could gather, the four of you are all travelling together.

Kate's reinforced ice seems to be holding up rather well against Hadrik's attacks. I'm quite sure that Tyrath would have sliced through her ice dragon as through butter. I guess his 'king of all dragons' title was not just for show after all.\r\n\r\nKate is now ramping up her attacks by also shooting Hadrik with hundreds of icicles while her ice dragon is still on his tail. Every time that Hadrik tries to go for Kate, she moves her cage out of his way, and sends her ice dragon to intercept him. Some of the icicles hit the black dragon in his left wing, and he starts falling from the sky, as the ice dragon takes full advantage of this opportunity and dives right onto its opponent.\r\n\r\nThe two dragons crash on the ground, with the ice one on top, pinning the black one into place with its claws. Kate is now slowly descending as well, still in her ice cage, and she looks at Hadrik, waiting for his next move.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, okay, I give up, you win!\" Hadrik says, as he transforms back into his dwarf form.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing his words, Kate brings her cage back down, and once she's safely on the ground, she dismisses both the cage and the dragon."

When we first met him, he just bypassed all of Daren's magical protections and put him to sleep with a simple wave of his hand. Oh, and one more thing.

I couldn't even sense a hint of his magical aura when he was hiding his presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interesting...\" Azarius says, as he smashes his staff into the ground and I feel a wave of air hit me in the face. \"Well, unless he also found a way to completely eliminate his physical presence from this plane, we can rest assured that he at least isn't listening to our conversation right now. I just used a sonar spell to detect all objects and persons in the area, and we are the only mages in this clearing. I also have another question for you. Do you know if he has any enemies here on this continent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he does! Tyrath, the dragon I've fought in the sky a few hours ago was looking specifically for Eiden and wanted him dead. I believe that he's made an enemy of the lessathi as well. He told us to deliver a message to any ancients we find, and tell them to 'remember the still winter'.

Thank you all very much for the patience you've shown me!\"\r\n\r\nShe then takes a deep bow, and prepares to take her leave.\r\n\r\n\"Kate, what are you saying all of a sudden?\" Rose asks her. \"You do realize we're coming with you, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are?\" Daren starts to say, but I hit him in the side with my elbow. \"I mean, uh... Of course we are. Naturally!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?...\" Kate says, shocked. \"No, Rose, you can't! What about all of the sick people waiting for you in your hometown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you don't need to worry about that!\" Rose says. \"With all of the shortcuts we've been taking so far, I am days ahead of my original schedule. I would've never had the courage to take such a direct route if you hadn't been there to escort me. Accompanying you on your way to meet your friend is the least I can do to pay you back. And besides, Hadrik said that the camp you are headed for isn't that far from here. Isn't that right, Hadrik?\""

I couldn't...\" Kate starts to say, but Hadrik interrupts her.\r\n\r\n\"It's settled then!\" he says loudly, completely drowning out the sound of Kate's voice. \"We all go to see Kate's friend! Now come on, follow me, I'm going to try and take a shortcut.\"\r\n\r\nWith these final words, we all grab our backpacks, and hurry up to follow Hadrik. Kate just stands there for a few moments, unsure of what to do, but then she decides to follow him too, and before long, she starts walking side by side with us again, as if our previous discussion never even took place.\r\n\r\nWe walk in complete silence for a few minutes. Kate has always been the silent type, so I'm not really surprised about her, but I don't think I've ever seen Daren go for more than a minute without opening his mouth. He must still be in shock after what he's heard about the Beacon. He's probably still having a hard time internalizing that information, given how adamantly he's been holding on to the opinion that Kate was a banshee until now.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, you guys sure are a quiet bunch!\" Hadrik says, after a few more minutes of awkward silence. \"Fine, I'll break the ice, then. Come on, ask me anything!\""

But shapeshifting magic can only be used to modify your size or to transform yourself into another creature. You cannot use it to disguise yourself as someone else. So I figured that you needed to have some sort of reason to make yourself seem smaller than you actually were. It was then that I remembered your giant form from when you first called out to us. Normally it should be impossible for someone to transform himself into a giant, because it would break the laws of shapeshifting. That made me realize that it must have been the other way around, and that the giant form was actually your original form.\"\r\n\r\nHadrik laughs again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you found out my secret,\" he says. \"What are you going to do now?

The reality is that the organizers likely just don't care. They didn't even bother to do some minimal screening of the contestants, and let hundreds of ordinary people like me join this tournament without even considering the implications. Why would they care if they also let in a giant or two?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you may be right,\" Hadrik says. \"Well, I guess that's enough questions for now. If we go on like this, I may well end up giving away my home address. Hahahahaha!\"\r\n\r\nAs we advance through the forest, we start seeing some bright yellow lights circling around the trees.  \r\n\r\n\"What are these, I wonder?\" I ask, as I point towards one of the yellow lights. \"Overgrown fireflies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh...\" Rose says. \"Oh, no...
