        text: "Both Daren and I turn around at the same time. We see a slim, tall figure standing behind us, with long black hair, fair skin, and a very serious look on her face. She is wearing leather pants, a long sleeved white blouse, and a green, hooded cloak. She appears to be somewhere in her early twenties. \r\n\r\nBut that's not all there is to this woman. I can also sense a strong magical aura all around her. An aura that couldn't possibly be coming from a regular human. Could she be... a banshee?\r\n\r\nMy heart starts beating rapidly again. That night from fifteen years ago is coming back to me. I can see it vividly, and I can still hear the laughter. That sinister, high-pitched laughter. Will it never stop haunting me?\r\n\r\nI breathe in deeply, and try to calm down. This woman can't be a banshee. The feeling I'm getting now is too different from the one I got back then. Does that mean she's a mage? No, that would be impossible. And yet... \r\n\r\n\"Barry,\" whispers Daren. \"Don't be afraid. I know white magic. I can purify her.\""

        paragraph: 3
        text: "I realize Daren must have also sensed the magic coming from the woman and concluded that she's been possessed by a banshee. Banshees are parasitic spirits that need to inhabit bodies in order to survive. They usually spend a few weeks inside a body in a dormant state before taking over. During this phase, the host may develop magical powers. Once a banshee is in full control of the body, they say she has awakened. The only way you can save the original host once she's been possessed by a banshee is to use white magic to purify her before the banshee has fully awakened, which basically means killing the banshee without harming the host.\r\n\r\nHowever, the purification technique operates on the assumption that a woman cannot have magic powers of her own. They call it purification, but all the technique does in fact is to completely eradicate the aura that gives off the strong magical vibe, with the purpose of also eliminating the banshee along with it. On the other hand, if the aura does not in fact belong to a banshee, but to the woman herself, the purification would be nothing short of a death sentence. \r\n\r\n\"No, wait. Listen to me!\" I blurt out. \"This woman isn't a banshee.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what, you're suggesting she's a mage, then? Barry, women can't be mages. There hasn't been a single recorded case of a woman mage in all of our world's history. Every time a woman's developed magical powers, it's been because of a banshee. Every single time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think I know that? But this one is different. If you try to purify her, you may well end up killing her!\""

        text: "\"How can you be so sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I've met a banshee before. Up close. Have you met a banshee before, Daren?\"\r\n\r\n\"...No,\" he admits.\r\n\r\n\"You just said you trusted me enough to tell me your greatest weakness. I'm asking you to trust me on this too. Can you trust me on this, Daren?\" \r\n\r\nDaren gives me one long look, and then he sighs deeply. \r\n\r\n\"Alright. We'll do it your way. But I'm keeping an eye on her. I swear, Barry, if it turns out you're only saying all of this because of her looks, I'm going to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you guys mind telling me what you've been whispering about for the past minute?\" the woman asks us."

The mage keeps teleporting after me, and trying to catch me off guard, but every time he thinks he's got me in a pinch, I simply dodge his strikes with ease. I knew that stat device would come in handy, but I never dared to dream it would be so useful. I feel like I could keep on doing this all day.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, what do you think you're doing? Stop fooling around and finish him! He's just an ordinary human!\" shouts the mage with the battleaxe.\r\n\r\nKate seems to have gone on the offensive. She is throwing ice cones towards the other young mage, and he is now forced to use his swords to cut them down, instead of attacking her. As he focuses more on defense, Kate's attacks become more and more relentless. It doesn't take her long until she starts sending hundreds of ice daggers towards her enemy. The mage doesn't seem to know how to use his technique to defend from such a large number of simultaneous attacks. It only takes a small miscalculation on his part to end the battle abruptly, as one of the ice daggers stabs him right through the heart, killing him on the spot."

With Daren's weakness against weapons and my lack of magical talents, that mage would probably have been the hardest for us to fight.\r\n\r\nAs the bearded mage reaches us, his battleaxe clashes loudly with Daren's sword.\r\n\r\n\"I see you've enchanted your weapon well, healer,\" says the older mage. \"But how long can you last against a battle-hardened warrior such as myself?\"\r\n\r\nHe roars, and presses his battleaxe harder against Daren's sword."

He can't afford to avert his eyes from the bearded mage even for a second. He is too dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the mage fighting Kate has managed to surround her with floating swords, aimed at her from every direction. He sends them all at her simultaneously in an attempt to overwhelm her defenses. She quickly surrounds herself with a sphere of very thick ice, and all of the swords, once again stop into it. As she dismisses the sphere, all the hundreds of swords drop to the ground, with a deafening clang."

As the sword throwing mage was still recovering from what he'd just seen happen, Kate took one of the many swords lying at her feet, and quickly sent it flying back towards its owner, impaling him through the heart and killing him on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt was a gruesome show, but at this point, all I care about is that I somehow managed to make it out of that alive."

You haven't been completely honest with me, and we almost died back there because of it. You're not really a stillwater, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No... I'm not,\" I admit.\r\n\r\n\"But you're not one of the locals either. Otherwise that spell of theirs would have alerted us the moment we sensed your presence.\"\r\n\r\nHe is talking about the spell the organizers of the tournament cast on each of the participants before teleporting us here. We aren't allowed to hurt the humans that live on this continent, so their spell warns us when one of them is near. If what they said can be believed, their spell is supposed to stop us even before we try hurting any of the locals. If it's accidental then it simply stops us before doing it. If it's intentional, it eliminates us from the tournament and sends us back. \r\n\r\nTheir spell is also supposed to act as a means of communication with the organizers. They said they'll transmit the objectives to each of us individually. It's funny. All of those careful preparations on their side, and they never even bothered to check if I was a mage or not. Hell, what am I saying? They probably didn't even care."

The Magium.\r\n\r\nNobody knows exactly what it looks like, or what it's made of, but everyone knows the fact that it is the source of all magic in the world, and that it can only be found on the continent of Varathia. All mages seek it. They crave it. They are certain that if they have access to it, they can increase their powers a hundredfold and become living legends. And although it is a common misconception that the Magium is only useful for learned mages, my studies have led me to believe that the Magium is so extraordinary that it can even turn a normal human into a mage."

A worldwide announcement by the kings of Varathia that they were organizing a tournament where every single mage in the world was invited. And the winner would be granted access to the Magium.   \r\n\r\nI knew then that there would never be another chance like this. \r\n\r\n\"Why did you join this tournament, Barry?\" Daren asks me again."
