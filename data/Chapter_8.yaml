As I start to see clearer, I notice that I am sitting in the middle of a room with stone walls and no windows, with the only visible exit being a metal bar door which seems to be locked shut. The stones used to build the walls look very old, are full of cracks, and there's moss growing all over them. If I were to guess, I'd say we are being held in the prison cell of some old ruins. I suddenly remember Kate's friend, and how she left us all unconscious in the middle of the forest. Is she the one that brought us here?\r\n\r\nI look around me to see if everyone's here. Daren is standing right beside me, while Kate and Rose are sitting on the floor on the opposite side of the room, with their backs leaned against the wall. Hadrik is standing near the metal bar door and knocking lightly on the walls around it, likely in an attempt to test their durability.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" I ask Daren. \"Did the lessathi bring us here?\""

Did they come by here while I was still unconscious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" says Daren. \"A tiger and a bear came by earlier and started growling at us. At first, I thought the jailers sent their pets here to scare us, but then Kate and Rose started talking to them, by making weird animal noises. It turns out that all of the animals and monsters on this continent can speak, but they only use ancient languages. Monsters can't speak in the common tongue because they don't know any better, and the animals aren't allowed to speak it because their spirit fox leader has forbidden its use after the humans started hunting them for food. It also turns out that having a basic understanding of ancient languages is not so uncommon if you were born on this continent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind all that,\" I tell Daren. \"Did they say what they want from us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, they said that we should wait here until their great golden fox arrives, and they apparently kept making jokes about how she will teach us all a lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, why aren't they guarding us, then? What's to stop us from just breaking through the walls and escaping?\"\r\n\r\n\"These,\" Daren says, as he points at his neck."

I turn to Kate.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, are these--\" I start to ask her but she cuts me off.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answers me. \"They're the same type of collars that the ancients used on artificial mages at the Beacon of Hope in order to keep their powers under control. The good news is that I know how to turn them off. The bad news is that we need to find the device that's powering all of these collars, before I can use it to deactivate them. These ruins were also built by the lessathi of old, so if they are anything like the Beacon, then there should be a control room not far from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if none of you can cast spells, then why is Hadrik still in his dwarf form?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I was wondering about that too,\" Hadrik says. \"I guess the collars don't actually dispel any spell that you cast on yourself before wearing them. They just prevent you from casting any more magic. The first thing I tried when I woke up was to turn into a giant, but this damn collar won't let me cast any sort of shapeshifting magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that you can't cast any magic...\" I tell him. \"But you still have your superhuman strength, right?\""

          "Aye!" Hadrik says, grinning. "But even with my power, I still can't
          smash the collar around my neck. These blasted contraptions seem to be
          near indestructible. Now I was checking to see if the walls are as
          durable as the collars, but it looks like they're just made up of
          regular stones. I should be able to break through them without any
          problem!"

Barry says that we should all stay here and eat cupcakes with the queen of magical fairy land. I say we should make a run for it now, while there's no one guarding our cell. Whoever also thinks that escaping now would be our best course of action, please raise your hand!\"\r\n\r\nAll four of them raise their hands simultaneously. Daren and Hadrik are both grinning at me, while Kate is looking away, and Rose is smiling apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Barry!\" she says.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Daren continues, \"since we're running a democracy here, I'm afraid that you were two votes short of a victory, Barry. It's too bad, the results were pretty close! Hadrik, whenever you're ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" the dwarf says, preparing to punch a hole in the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" I say, and Hadrik interrupts his swing to look at me."

What if they're baiting us to escape, so that they can capture us again on more severe charges? Right now, the only thing we're guilty of is temporarily trespassing on their territory. Given that we are outsiders and do not know these lands very well, we should have extenuating circumstances. But if we try to escape now, we'll most surely have to fight some of the animals, and we might even be forced to kill some of them. Do we really want to make enemies of an entire race just because of a small misunderstanding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmm...\" Hadrik says thoughtfully, while stroking his beard. \"The lad does have a point.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" Daren tells him.\r\n\r\n\"Rose,\" I continue, \"didn't you tell us that this spirit fox of theirs is like some kind of god? Isn't she like, crazy strong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Rose says. \"She is thousands of years old and likely dwarfs the power of most mages from this tournament.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, would you choose to make her into our enemy right off the bat, knowing that there might be a small chance to talk things through with her if we just have a little patience?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when you put it like that, I suppose I wouldn't!\" Rose says, smiling."

We'll have a talk with this great golden fox and see where we go from there.\"\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take long for the animals' leader to make her appearance. Her shape is that of a normal fox, but her fur is so bright that it looks like it's made of actual gold. The magical aura that she emanates is rather intimidating, and it also gives off an outworldly vibe. A similar vibe in fact to that of a banshee. Could she originate from the magical plane as well?\r\n\r\nThe fox is being accompanied by a leopard and a bull, one on her left side and one on her right, just like two bodyguards walking alongside some rich noble kid. When they all stop in front of our cell, the fox starts speaking to us, in the common tongue."

The leopard either didn't hear his remark, or didn't deem it worthy of a reaction on his part. The fox simply ignores them altogether, and continues her speech, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\"My loyal subjects informed me that you were caught trespassing on our sacred grounds.

But if that's true, why do you think she'd be hiding that fact from us?\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter who she is,\" Kate interrupts us. \"She clearly knows this place better than us, and if she were working with the animals, she would have already alerted them of our presence. Either way, there's only one path for us to take at this point, so we don't really have much choice than to go after her. We'll decide later if we should trust her or not.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we catch up with Flower, we hear her start talking with a much colder tone than before. While she speaks, she is still walking down the corridor, and her back is turned to us.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with you, Flower?\" she says in her cold voice. \"We came to these desolate ruins to train, not to play the tour guide! We don't even know who these people are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Relax, Petal!\" the girl says, this time in her previous cheerful tone. \"They seem like nice people. We can get back to training once we're done showing them around! This shouldn't take long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, who are you talking to?\" Kate asks her.\r\n\r\nFlower gets startled by Kate's question, and quickly turns around to face her.\r\n\r\n\"D-did we say that out loud?\" she asks. \"I mean 'me'! 'Me', not 'we'! Because there's only one of me!\""

You're crazy!\"\r\n\r\nShe then starts laughing very nervously and unnaturally.\r\n\r\n\"Did she just call me crazy?\" Daren asks us.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there's a muffled laughter coming from within the golden amulet that Flower is wearing around her neck. The girl opens up the amulet and starts talking to it.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Arraka!\" she says.\r\n\r\nNow that I can hear the laughter clearer, I realize that the voice inside the amulet is made up of three different voices, all women, laughing simultaneously. Once the being inside the amulet realizes that we can now hear her clearly, she starts speaking to us.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you there!\" the voice says. \"This girl's a banshee! Quick, check her magical aura! Check her magical au--\""

          Flower panics and she closes the amulet, shutting the voice up, but
          the harm had already been done. As I analyze her magical aura in
          detail, I realize that it's in fact a lot more powerful than it seems,
          and that she's willfully suppressing it in order to make it seem like
          that of a normal human. But is she an actual banshee, or another
          artificial mage like Kate? There's something off about her aura... I
          can't tell exactly what. It feels almost as if she has two distinct
          magical auras around her, one that gives off an outworldly vibe, and
          one that doesn't. It's as if both the girl and the banshee that
          possessed her are somehow coexisting in the same body, as two separate
          entities. But that's impossible... Isn't it?

I can then flood the room with water so that we can all swim up to that hole in the ceiling!  Can you guys swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm dressed from head to toe in heavy armor, so what do you think?!\" Daren asks her.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, okay! New plan! I think there was a secret mechanism in the room above to stop the walls from moving! Petal, can you give me a boost?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl puts both arms alongside her, with her palms facing downwards. Two powerful jets of water start erupting out of her hands, which lift her into the air, and right through the hole in the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell?\" Daren says. \"Didn't she use fire magic just a moment ago?

She rolls out of its way, and triggers two more traps by accident. There are now dozens of arrows shooting out of both walls, while sharp spinning blades are coming out of the floor and moving in circles all around her. At first glance, the girl appears to be just clumsily stumbling around while evading the traps out of sheer luck. As I watch her more closely, I realize that even though her movements all seem erratic, they have a way of flowing into one another which allows her to not waste even a single second between two actions. I guess she wasn't kidding when she said that she came to this place to train her acrobatic skills.\r\n\r\nHadrik shakes his head as he watches the girl jump around, and then he lays flat on the floor, with his ear pressing against the ground, trying to listen for something.\r\n\r\n\"Uh, guys, I know this looks bad,\" Flower tells us as she jumps off a wall, lands on her left hand and then bounces off the floor like a spring, \"but if I keep going like this, I'll either remember the right path, or end up setting off all of the traps, so it's a win either way!\""

The only way we're killing it is if we can find out where its heart is and stab it, or if we use fire, to prevent it from regenerating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damnations...\" Kate says. \"If only I had my ice magic, I would have easily cut all those heads off simultaneously...\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't that little girl have fire magic?\" Daren asks.\r\n\r\nHe then starts to shout the girl's name, while looking at the hole in the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Flower!

Now you can all die in peace, knowing that you've achieved your goal.\"\r\n\r\nI suddenly realize where all the light was coming from. The great golden fox is standing right before us, and her insanely strong magical aura is shining so brightly that it's hard to even look at her. Her shape may be that of a normal fox, but her aura gives off an outworldly vibe. A similar vibe in fact to that of a banshee. Could she originate from the magical plane as well?\r\n\r\nAs I look around, I see that the room we are in is filled with levers and buttons of all shapes and sizes, just like Flower said, and there are strange writings on all of the walls. Besides the fox, there is also a leopard in the room, who appears to be one of the fox's followers."

One that is punishable by death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you kidding me?!\" Daren says. \"Who sentences someone to a life of labor like that just because they happened to walk into a forbidden area by accident? Do you also execute your fawns and cubs if they don't keep off the grass in a park?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would be wise to not address me in such a casual manner, mage in armor,\" the golden fox says. \"But to answer your question, the animal kingdom has neither parks, nor a rule to keep off the grass in any region of the continent. However, if there were such a rule, and a cub or a fawn were to break it, then I assure you I would not hesitate in ordering their execution. Rules are meant to be upheld, both by humans and by animals. The fact that you humans are so lenient with your rules is one of the main reasons why your society is decaying to such a degree. I will hear no more of this.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a golden cage pops out of nowhere and surrounds every one of us except Flower.\r\n\r\n\"The five of you are not worth another second of my time,\" the fox says. \"I am going to execute you here and now and be done with this once and for all.\""

As I reach the end of the corridor myself, it takes a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the really bright light in this room.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations!\" I hear a familiar voice say to us, while my vision is still a little blurry. \"You've made it to the control room. Now you can all die in peace, knowing that you've achieved your goal.\"\r\n\r\nI suddenly realize where all the light was coming from. The spirit fox is standing right before us, and her insanely strong magical aura is shining so brightly that it's hard to even look at her. Leo, the leopard is also at her side, but the bull appears to be missing this time around. The room is filled with levers and buttons of all shapes and sizes, just like Flower said, and there are strange writings on all of the walls.\r\n\r\n\"Once I learned that you escaped from the dungeon,\" the fox says, \"I knew that there was only one place where you could be heading, so instead of chasing you down, I decided to simply wait for you here.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a golden cage pops out of nowhere and surrounds every one of us except Flower.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that my benevolence was wasted on the likes of you,\" the fox says. \"I am going to execute you here and now and be done with this once and for all.\""

            text: "The magical power coming from her is like nothing I've ever witnessed before. I haven't even felt so much pressure when I was in the presence of Azarius. The hopelessness I'm feeling right now can only be compared with the feeling I got when we first met Eiden. Are we all just going to die like this, without even getting a chance to offer the slightest amount of resistance?\r\n\r\n\"Eleya, wait!\" the girl says, as she puts herself between us and the spirit fox. \"You can't hurt them! They're not bad people!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not stand in my way, Flower,\" the fox says. \"These people broke our sacred rules, and they must be punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but can't you like, give them a slap on the wrist or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to have you question our methods or our punishments, little girl. You may have helped us in the past, but if you insist on defending these criminals, I will not hesitate to execute you along with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ooooooh! You are always so stubborn!\" the girl says, as her eyes turn a bright red, and her magical aura starts to radiate strongly from her body. \"Fine! If you want a fight, I'll give you your fight! Get ready, Petal!\""

We cannot afford to send any more of our troops to the ogre stronghold. At this rate, the sacred chalice will be lost forever. But these warriors have proven their combat prowess when they defeated our hydra pet from the subterranean level. We could send them to retrieve the chalice, in exchange for their freedom.\""

Of all the animals in our kingdom, you are by far the one who hates humans the most. I never thought I'd see the day when you would suggest using any of them to further our cause.\"\r\n\r\nShe pauses for a bit to ponder on his words.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" the fox says. \"In full accordance with the sixth golden rule, I hereby grant you full custody of these five prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nEleya then turns to us.\r\n\r\n\"You were lucky to have been spared in such a way, humans,\" she says. \"I suggest you make the most of this opportunity.\""

It is heavily defended, and very hard to infiltrate. Besides regular warriors, I am told that the ogres also have a few powerful mages within their ranks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we get our collars temporarily deactivated once we get to the ogre stronghold?\" Kate asks. \"I've seen collars like these before, and I know for a fact that they could be activated and deactivated at will, without having to remove them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that the collars we use are a more primitive version of the ones you know of,\" the fox says. \"Their effects will not go away unless we remove them completely, and I am not going to have them removed until you have retrieved the golden chalice. I will give you a time limit of five days to complete your quest. This should give you more than enough time to get the task done. If you are not back within five days, I will assume that you've abandoned your quest, and I will use these collars to have you killed by electrocution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five days?!\" Hadrik asks. \"What if we get lost on our way there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't,\" the fox says. \"Because I'm sending a guide with you to show you the way.\""
