Obviously, I didn't know this at first, and just like you guys, I thought that this was my one chance to change my mistake from the past. It took me a long while to understand what the ritual actually wanted from me. It took me even longer to realize that I had to reenact everything that happened, not just the boulder pushing, so I actually had to go down to the village and check every single house for the non-existent survivors, getting a close look at every single one of the people I've killed, including the women and children. Not exactly the best experience to have, considering how hard I've been trying to forget those faces after they've haunted my dreams for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gods, that's horrible...\" Flower says. \"But... how did this lead to you having a fight with your parents?\""

The leader pretty much laughed in my face, telling me that our war crime rules only applied for wars with other clans of giants, not for our ongoing war with the dwarves. He also told me that those children would have probably grown up to become soldiers later anyway, so it was better to take them out while they were still young. That was the first time when I realized how differently our people would treat the concept of honor when it came to races other than giants. Obviously, I couldn't just let this go, and I tried to get justice for those dead dwarves through every means at my disposal. The other giants thought I was joking at first, but when they understood that I was being serious, they began to treat me a lot more coldly, calling me a dwarf sympathizer, and saying that I no longer had the right to call myself a warrior after taking the side of our enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why Gontrok said your parents think you've lost your honor?\" Daren asks."

        paragraph: 3
        text: "\"Not only because of this, but it was part of the reason, yes,\" Hadrik says. \"The other part of the reason was the fact that when I realized I couldn't get any justice for the dead dwarves by staying with my clan, I decided to go on a self-imposed exile, shapeshifting myself into a dwarf so that I could infiltrate the dwarven lands and track down the remaining relatives of the innocent civilians I killed in that village. Obviously, leaving the clan for a reason like this would pretty much guarantee that I would no longer be welcome if I ever chose to come back. This didn't matter to me, though, because all I wanted was to make things right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you manage to find any of those relatives, in the end?\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" Hadrik says. \"It turned out that some of the dwarves I killed that night were only visiting the village, and they left their kids behind, in their own towns. When I found out about this, I took it upon myself to raise those kids until they came of age, and I also helped out a few other kids that had been orphaned because of the war, along the years. Eventually, the war between the giants and the dwarves ended, and the kids that I helped had grown up, now having their own jobs, wives and children, but I no longer had a place to call home back in the giant nation, so I decided to remain in the dwarven lands and to continue my life shapeshifted as a dwarf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did those dwarves never find out that you were a giant?\" Melindra says."

          that time I'd already lived with them for a long time, so they didn't
          really care that much anymore. After spending so much time in the
          dwarven lands I pretty much started talking, acting and drinking like
          any other dwarf, so the majority of them didn't really see much of a
          difference to begin with. The one thing that I still longed for was
          the fighting, though. As a giant, it was practically in my blood, and
          I had gotten a bit tired of having to hold back during tavern brawls
          so that I wouldn't kill anyone by accident. That's why I eventually
          started to go on adventures by myself all around the world, so that I
          could finally find some adversaries that would be able to provide me
          with a true challenge. I would always end up returning to the dwarven
          lands after a while, and I would go drink in their taverns some more,
          but even after all this time, I still never had the guts to tell them
          what was my initial reason for starting to shapeshift as a dwarf.

Leila tells me about her life with her father after she left the beacon, and I tell her about various things that I've seen while travelling through the Western Continent. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, talking with Leila like this feels really natural, as if we've known each other for a long time, and now we're just catching up with what the other's been doing since the last time we talked.

This treatment works best if you catch the disease in its early stages, but if you catch it too late, the chances of survival decrease drastically.

We will have to wait for a bit longer until we can draw some definitive conclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if it's only half of them, this is still much more than we could have hoped for,\" Desmond says. \"Until today, anyone who went through that door was considered to be a dead man. Now it's possible that we might not even need to send people into quarantine anymore. You should be proud of what you've accomplished here, healer.
