Once we get close to the height level of our division's cells, a second trapdoor opens up, and the platform slows down to a halt, as we finally reach our destination. Almost immediately after it stops, the elevator changes its course, and it starts to descend back towards the lower levels. We jump off the platform and onto the cell's floor, while the trapdoor closes itself back up, blocking the elevator from our view.\r\n\r\nAs I take a look around, I realize that the room we've arrived in is not in fact Leila's room, but my own. I guess it's a good thing that I chose cell number three when I was asked about it by the desk worker. If I'd chosen cell number five instead, this room would have likely been taken by the mage who got locked here yesterday. \r\n\r\nAs we stand in the middle of my room, a small puddle is beginning to form below our feet, due to the water that is dripping from our clothes."

It's just until your own clothes dry off. Come on, let's go inside. I want to tell you what I found out while reading my notebook.\"\r\n\r\nWe both enter her room, and I spend the next fifteen minutes telling her the most important parts about my findings. She listens closely to what I have to say, while taking a bite from the beef jerky I gave her, every so often. After I'm done talking, she puts the jerky on the bed, beside her, and she starts to write.\r\n\r\n\"From what you're telling me,\" Leila writes, \"I understand that our biggest problem by far will be the troll, and his higher than average regeneration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I tell her. \"It is already known that a troll can regenerate fast enough to not die from a wound to the heart, but a troll being able to survive with its head cut off is something that I didn't think was possible. I guess it goes to show how little we really know about regeneration in general. According to all the books I've read, any living being that's had its head severed from its body should not be able to live any longer, regardless of how high its regeneration is. The fact that the body could even regenerate its head contradicts our most basic knowledge about how a troll's body is supposed to work.\""

        text: "\"But the troll didn't regenerate his head,\" Leila writes. \"The head kept talking from the ground, and the body had to pick it back up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right!\" I say. \"This means that the link between the body and the head is somehow not broken, even after the two of them get separated. Maybe we can use this. If the troll is still using its head to see and hear even after it's been severed from the body, then maybe we can cut his head off, pick it up, and then blindfold it, or something, leaving his body defenseless!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that the troll would leave himself open like that again, in the arena,\" Leila writes. \"I used the element of surprise before, but now he knows how fast I am, and he won't let me cut his head off again so easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the only way you can kill a regular troll,\" I say, \"is either by cutting its head off or by burning it alive. If cutting the head off is not an option, then the only alternative we have left is fire. That being said, getting access to any sort of flames will be next to impossible in the arena, and that troll is even wearing anti-magic armor, which gives him protection to fire. Even if we somehow manage to find a way to burn him, we'd first have to damage his armor badly enough that the magical protections on it would wear off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we should talk about all this with the other members of our division?\" Leila writes. \"Maybe they could come up with some ideas.\""

I omitted to tell them how exactly we reached the tunnels, and I did not tell them about our encounter with Flower and Illuna either, but I tried to describe the rest of our adventure to them in as much detail as possible, while simultaneously avoiding to tell them any information that might lead them to know that we are lessathi, and that we are using stat devices. After I got done with the story, I also gave them a quick summary of what I know about each of the creatures we've met, including their behaviors and their weaknesses, and I also told them my theory about the troll's unusual regeneration ability.\r\n\r\n\"This is all very useful information,\" Wilhelm says. \"I happened to overhear the guards last night saying that we'd be fighting a troll named Velgos in the second round, but I would have never imagined him to be so powerful. What I would like to add is that I've also heard them talk about manticores, which I don't believe you've met in the underground caverns. If your notebook has as much information in it as you've claimed, maybe you should do some research about them as well.\"\r\n\r\nI'll definitely look into it,\" I say. \"Thanks for letting me know.\""

I'm not really one to talk, because I've never studied magic, but it seems a little far-fetched to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like Leila's idea about crushing the head better,\" Bruce says. \"I doubt he'll be able to regenerate it once it's been cut off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Either way,\" Wilhelm says, \"what I think we can all agree on is that there's no way we could face these enemies alone. I know that we can't really stand each other, but we're going to have to call a truce until at least after the arena events. Our survival depends on it.\""

I didn't really get involved much in their discussion, since I can't say that I'd trust any of them to have my back during a fight.

I'll definitely have to keep an eye on him so he doesn't take me by surprise. I decide to think no further about this, and I go to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I get woken up in the morning by one of the guards, telling me to pack my bags, because we're leaving in twenty minutes. I put all my stuff back in my backpack, and then I walk out the door and into the recreation room, where the other members of my division were slowly starting to gather up. As soon as we're all set to go, we begin to leave our division's area one by one, and we stop outside the door, where we are greeted by an employee of the arena, who collects all of our keys, and tells us to follow him."

The few spectators who came in late are now hurrying as fast as they can towards their seats, as the announcer is doing a few tests, to make sure that his voice magnifier is working properly. Soon, the constant murmur that could be heard throughout the arena slowly dies out, and the announcer takes a deep breath, preparing to officially announce the beginning of the arena event.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome,\" the announcer says. \"Welcome to all! I don't think that there is any reason for me to make a lengthy introduction this time around. You all know why you're here. You came here because you were promised the event of the century, and we plan to deliver on that promise. Now, if it's alright with everyone, I would like to begin by announcing the rules.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcer waits for a few moments, in order to make sure that there are no objections, and then he continues to read from his notepad."

          "By the request of the arena's owner himself, mister Venard," the
          announcer says, "today's event will follow the traditional rules,
          which had been used by his father before him and by the lessathi of
          old, before the still winter. As most of you may already know, this
          also means that if a gladiator breaks one of the rules, they will not
          be disqualified from participating any further, but they will become
          an undesirable. By becoming an undesirable, a gladiator will be forced
          to participate in an additional round after the official event ends,
          where they will need to fight all of the other remaining gladiators at
          once, in one final battle. Any gladiator who manages to give the
          finishing blow to an undesirable will get rewarded either with his
          freedom, or with a large sum of money, depending on their status in
          this arena. Other gladiators can of course refuse to participate in
          this final round, and undesirables can also choose to no longer
          participate in the regular rounds, once they have been pegged as rule
          breakers."

If a gladiator is caught using magic, if they try to kill their teammates, or if they attack any of the spectators, they will be executed on the spot. The undesirable rule only applies for the rules of the actual event. Moving on, the traditional rules of the arena state that the arena events must be divided into exactly three rounds. The first round, as I'm sure you've already been told, will be fought against a variety of mythical creatures that have never been used before in this arena. We do have a surprise for the second round, however. For this special occasion, instead of our reigning champion, I think you will be happy to learn that the warrior who will be joining us is none other than the relentless mercenary Velgos!\"\r\n\r\nThere is a loud murmur in the crowd when they hear the name of Velgos. From what I can tell, they seem excited about the prospect of watching him fight.\r\n\r\n\"In the third round,\" the announcer says, \"the gladiators that survived the first two rounds will need to fight in a series of duels, to decide who will be the victors of this event. Some of the duels will have to be fought to the death, while others will be fought only until one of the fighters surrenders. The exact duels will be decided after the end of round two, when we will know exactly which of the fighters have survived. And now that we got all of the introductions out of the way, I believe it is finally time to get this event started. Is everyone ready?\""

It takes only a few seconds for the manticores that had been circling the skies all this time to dive down, to sink their claws into the warriors' chests, and then to soar back into the air, carrying their prey. \r\n\r\nThe screams of the gladiators silence the crowd completely, as the beasts fly higher and higher. Two of the gladiators dropped their swords from the pain, immediately after being attacked, but one of them managed to keep hold of his weapon, and he's now using it to stab his attacker in the underbelly. The manticore screams, and it drops the warrior, who falls to the ground and crushes his head against the hard soil. The other two gladiators are raised a bit higher by their attackers, but then they also get dropped to the ground, and they die on impact.\r\n\r\nThe remaining warriors are now finally starting to panic. Their leader was among the ones who died. Having lost the person who was giving them directions, the gladiators begin to break their formation, and the marauders take advantage of this by grabbing one of the warriors with their claws, while another marauder impales him with its tail."

Both the crowd and the announcer fall completely silent, as they watch Hadrik walk calmly, and then stop in the middle of the arena, in order to chug down the last contents of his bottle.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Hadrik exclaims. \"There's nothing like a fine bottle of dwarven ale to raise your appetite before a battle!\"\r\n\r\nHe then starts turning his head around, as if he were looking for something. \r\n\r\n\"Say, you wouldn't happen to have something that I could throw this empty bottle away in, would you?\" he shouts towards the announcer, as he shows him the empty bottle in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe announcer watches him, with a puzzled expression on his face, without saying anything."

The monster starts screaming in pain, as Hadrik makes a quick jump, landing with his fist on top of the marauder, and smashing it against the ground, causing a loud shockwave while also forming a small crater below the creature, due to the force of the impact. \r\n\r\nOne of the manticores that was still up in the sky quickly dives down to grab Hadrik in its claws, but the dwarf steps away at the exact moment when the monster reaches him, and he grabs it by the tail. He then spins it around for about four seconds, building momentum, and then he throws it at a wall far away from him with all his might, causing the beast to smash right through it with a loud booming noise.\r\n\r\nThe crowd and the announcer are both speechless.

Unlike regular porcupines, the quills on their backs are deadly weapons, and they are sharp and durable enough to give elven steel a run for its money. The creatures have the ability to launch their quills as projectiles, with a very high accuracy and speed. Due to their high regeneration rate, they also have the ability to regrow their quills almost instantly. This provides them with a near unlimited stock of ammunition to use against their foes. Their appearance and their behavior have led people to call these creatures 'archer porcupines'.\r\n\r\nA few of the porcupines that have positioned themselves several dozen feet behind Hadrik are now turning their backs towards him, getting ready to attack. Hadrik is still fighting the marauders, and he doesn't seem to have noticed the porcupines. Should I shout a warning to him? I wouldn't want to distract him in the middle of his battle, but if those porcupines manage to aim their shots right, he might be in trouble."

Very well, ambassador. I will speak with the staff in charge of arranging the fights to make some modifications in the schedule. You will not be seeing him again.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they've finished their discussion, the room above falls silent again.

            text: "There is a very loud burst of cheering coming from the outside. It appears that Daren and the other surviving gladiators have finally defeated all of the creatures. The announcer is signaling them to leave the fighting area, so that the show can proceed. \r\n\r\nAs Daren and the others are getting ready to leave, a man dressed in a dark blue robe with a hood on his head comes from behind me, and he joins my side by the iron grating.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" I ask him, even though I can probably already guess the answer.\r\n\r\n\"I am a last minute addition to your division,\" the man says. \"I've been sent here to solve your troubles.\"\r\n\r\nThe man is carrying two scythes in his hands, that both have sapphires encrusted into their hilts.\r\n\r\n\"You were sent here by the lessathi?\" I ask him in a low voice, in order to make sure that none of the others hear me. \"What were they thinking? Don't tell me that you plan to fight all of the monsters by yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will uphold our end of the bargain,\" the lessathi says. \"Make sure that you uphold yours when the time comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, yes,\" I say. \"Yes, of course...\"\r\n\r\nThe lessathi suddenly turns his head towards me, with an expression of shock and rage in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are lying!\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I ask him. \"No, I was telling the truth!\""

            text: "\"You are a fool!\" the lessathi shouts. \"Any person with passable skills in reading auras could tell that you are lying from the way your aura is trembling right now. Don't you have any idea what happens to people that lie to us? I should kill you right now for your insolence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, what's going on, here?\" Bruce asks, after hearing the lessathi's shouts. \"Who are you, and what are you doing in our division?\"\r\n\r\nThe lessathi calms down, and he puts his scythes away when he sees Bruce confront him. It seems that despite his earlier remark, he would rather avoid a conflict that would draw too much attention to himself.\r\n\r\n\"The deal is off,\" the lessathi says, as he heads out of our division's area. \"Enjoy your last fight.\"\r\n\r\nHe then walks out the door, without saying another word.\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, who was that?\" Bruce says. \"What did he want?\"\r\n\r\n\"No idea,\" I say. \r\n\r\nLeila looks at me suspiciously, but she says nothing. Meanwhile, the iron grating in front of us is finally being raised. \r\n\r\nWe all make our way towards the center of the arena, like all the divisions before us."

It's clear that they do not recognize anyone from our division. They're probably already thinking that we're going to get butchered, like that first division from earlier. I hope we won't end up proving them right."
