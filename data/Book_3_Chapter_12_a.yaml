        text: "\"Arraka, wake up!\" Illuna says. \"Barry already completed the task you gave him ten minutes ago. If you don't give him something to do, he'll start testing that obnoxious spell of his with the blinding flash of light over and over again, and none of us want that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I say, \"you should be grateful that I tested that spell as many times as I did. The last thing you'd want during a tense fight would be for me to blind you by accident because I didn't practice enough. That spell has very delicate timing, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it does,\" Illuna tells me in a dismissive tone, and then she picks up the amulet again so she can speak louder into it. \"Arraka, seriously, what are you doing? We've been calling out to you for ages and you haven't responded at all. Don't make me spin you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright, alright!\" Arraka says, in an exasperated tone. \"I'll give Barry his blasted task. Just give me one more minute. I'm kind of in the middle of something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me guess,\" Illuna says. \"You're trying to find an explosion spell that requires less energy to cast, so that you can take us by surprise the next time when you try to escape from the amulet. Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong,\" Arraka says. \"If there were a faster explosion spell, I would have used it years ago. But if you have to know, I am currently trying to create a modified version of my soul absorption spell where instead of absorbing the host's soul, I fuse with them, and we both get equal control of the body.\""

        text: "\"You mean... like me and Flower?\" Illuna asks, perplexed. \"But... why? What could you possibly have to gain from doing something like this on purpose? I thought you hated it when you got fused with Therius by accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" Arraka says. \"But you see, the thing is that if I ever do escape from my amulet again, for whatever reason, I can't afford to take over Flower's body the same way as last time, because then you'd both essentially be dead, everyone would attack me to avenge you again, and I'd be forced to murder them all, for good this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why exactly would that be a problem for you?...\" Illuna asks, still just as confused as before. \"You've already killed us once. Why not just do it again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because then my whole plan to use you all to take my vengeance upon the gods would be ruined!\" Arraka shouts. \"I'm not going to get another opportunity like this in a million years! Where else do you think I'm going to find another clown troupe that has a personal beef with one of the gods and has a minimal chance of killing them with my guidance? You think I want to go back to my boring old plan of just killing them myself after I came up with a genius idea like this?\""

        text: "\"You can't be serious...\" Illuna says. \"You're telling me that you're willing to live together with me AND Flower in the same mind, while sharing control of the body with both of us, just for the sake of your plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, sure, why not?\" Arraka says, in a casual tone. \"We can have the tea parties with biscuits and whatever in the morning, and then we'll do the murder sprees in the evening. I'm sure we can work something out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I am finding this very hard to believe...\" Illuna says.\r\n\r\n\"As you should,\" Arraka tells her. \"If you would have been so easily ready to trust the word of someone who already killed you once, then it would have meant that you've learned nothing from me during the years when you were my pupil.\""

            text: "\"Well, I personally believe Arraka,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"See that?\" Arraka tells Illuna. \"Barry's a gullible moron. All I need to do is act friendly with him for a few days and he thinks I'm harmless. Aren't you glad that you didn't end up like him?\"\r\n\r\n\"On that alone, I will have to agree with you,\" Illuna says, begrudgingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever you say,\" I tell them. \"If you need me, I'll be over there, by those rocks, testing a few more spells.\"\r\n\r\nI let Arraka focus on researching her new spell while I head to a more isolated part of our camp, which is perfect for me letting loose a little and experimenting with my newly acquired magic. During the two days since we've left the lessathi base, I've been spending as much time as possible cataloguing my available spells in my notebook and testing each one of them out, to make sure that I could indeed use them when required."

              I've also tried out quite a few combinations of spells that I'd
              discovered while doing research with Brinhorn back in the days,
              but some of these turned out to be trickier than I thought.
              Unsurprisingly, it turns out that it's much easier to theorize on
              the effects of a spell combination than to actually manage to use
              it in practice. Combining spells is a really advanced technique,
              after all, and the stat device doesn't really have any built-in
              features to help me with this, since it was designed to cast the
              spells separately.

If only I could figure out a pattern or something that could help me-- wait a minute, I think I got it!\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it's only a theory at best, but I don't have any time to confirm it, so I'll just have to go with my gut feeling on this one. It seems to me that the aura around the fingertips of his left hand is getting slightly pulled in the direction that he plans to run towards, briefly before he moves his legs. I also think I might be able to somewhat estimate how far he's gonna go, based on how quickly his aura gets pulled in the given direction.\r\n\r\nI doubt I'll be able to get this right on the first try, so I'd better begin now and adjust my aim gradually with every new attempt.\r\n\r\nI choose the quickest spell I have in my arsenal, which is a very weak dizziness spell that only slightly disorients you for a few seconds, and then I aim it at the spot where I think Hadrik is about to arrive. I miss my timing by about half a second, and the spell does not activate.\r\n\r\nStill, that went much better than I thought it would. After only a few adjustments, I think I should be able to accurately predict where Hadrik is about to go."

Is this a dizziness spell I'm feeling? Oh, the effect is gone already!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, well, it's probably the weakest dizziness spell that exists, so it's not exactly very useful,\" I say, \"but at least I was finally able to cast a targeted spell at someone, so from my point of view this experiment was a success!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, in that case, I'm glad I could help!\" Hadrik says, as he goes to pick up his bottle from the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving already?\" I say, with a hint of disappointment in my voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I'd say that was enough fun for one evening,\" Hadrik says. \"If you're really in need of more experimenting, maybe we can find an orc patrol tomorrow or something for you to work with.

You're really trying to tell me that this had anything to do with you learning magic?\"  \r\n\r\n\"No, of course not,\" I say. \"It had nothing to do with me learning magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why would you do it?!\" Illuna asks, looking as if she's finally losing her cool.\r\n\r\n\"Because he's a generalist,\" Arraka says. \"He's the only one in this group who understands enough magical theory that I don't need to jump through hoops to make him follow my instructions, no matter how idiotic and nonsensical they may seem to the rest of you. He may have disagreed with how well my training would work in practice, but he knew that there were no flaws in the theory behind it. He would have never accepted to do any of this otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" I say, \"the whole thing with hitting my head against the tree so that I could imprint my aura onto it and make it an easier target for my spell was something that I tried to do many years before I could use magic. It's not really a very well-known method of training, because it's hard to take seriously, but it can have an immensely positive effect on mages with very weak magical power who can't learn to cast spells any other way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why would you need to go through all this trouble NOW, when you can already cast magic?\" Illuna says. \"Why not simply cast it through the use of your stat device?\""

        text: "\" 'Fire arrow' is not on his list of spells,\" Arraka says. \"That was the whole point of this exercise. I made him cast the easiest spell that couldn't possibly be included in his device, because his stat booster was invented over six hundred years ago and the fire arrow spell was only created a hundred years later. I don't think you understand just how much of a leap forward this is. Until now, Barry was under the impression that casting anything other than the spells included in his device was fundamentally impossible. Now that we've clearly established that he can cast other spells as well, this has opened up an infinite amount of new options for him. With enough practice, he might be able to learn to cast some of the special spells designed by me, and hell, maybe even primordial spells. It's only a matter of time at this point.\"\r\n\r\n\"I... didn't realize you two were actually thinking so far ahead,\" Illuna says, now appearing to have calmed down.\r\n\r\n\"Well... why wouldn't we?\" I say. \"We ARE trying to kill a god, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes...\" Illuna says. \"I suppose we are. And the fact that we seem to be getting realistically closer to this goal makes me doubt my own sanity more and more with every passing day...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah!\" Arraka says. \"You ain't seen nothing yet! Stick with me and soon, killing a few gods will feel like an ordinary afternoon!\""

        text: "\"Hey, Hadrik!\" I tell the dwarf as he is passing by us, looking just as puzzled as Illuna was in the beginning. \"Pour me a glass of ale, would you? I just cast my first fire arrow! See that scorch mark over there on the tree? That was me! Hahahaha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uhm... good for you, man!\" Hadrik says, as he pats me on the back, very unconvinced. \"Good for you!\"\r\n\r\nSoon after Hadrik takes out the glass, Diane joins us as well, and then Kate and Daren also head over to us to see what the commotion was all about. It took me some time to explain to them why casting this insignificant spell was such a big deal for me, and to convince them that I hadn't completely taken leave of my senses when I agreed to smash my head against a tree for a whole hour, but once I cleared up everything, we all sat down in a circle and enjoyed the rest of our evening, taking a brief rest from all of our trainings.\r\n\r\n\"So, Barry, now that you can cast any spell you want, without any limitations, what are you planning to try next?\" Flower asks me, as she subtly tries to pick up a bottle of dwarven ale, but then her eyes briefly turn blue and she slaps her own hand away from the bottle. \"If you want some suggestions, I highly recommend the spell where you make a huge dragon out of flames that you can use to--\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt that's how it works,\" Illuna interrupts her. \"He might not be limited by the list of spells provided by his device anymore, but his magical power level is still very low. This means that he will only be able to cast very weak spells for the time being.\""

        text: "\"Exactly,\" Arraka says. \"See, this is why the spells made by me are so great, compared to the ones created by all the other simpletons. With my original spells, you are not limited by the amount of energy that you have at your disposal. You can make the spells as strong or as weak as you want, depending on how much energy you want to spend on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're beginning to sound like a salesperson that is trying much too hard to sell their faulty products,\" Illuna says. \"We only just saw that the fire arrow that Barry cast works the same way, so clearly your spells are not as unique as you're making them out to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pfft...\" Arraka says. \"Fire arrow doesn't count. That's one of the newer spells. Show me a spell from before five thousand years ago that does what my spells do, and then we'll talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aaanyway...\" I say. \"To answer Flower's question, I suppose that what I'd want to try out first are some spells with easier flows to recreate, so that I can get some more practice before I begin with the complicated ones. I'd probably start with something like the frog summoning spell from the Beginner's guide to summoning magic. Hmm, or maybe the floating dagger spell that those scam artists like to use when they pretend to be juggling. Oh, or I could try the one spell where you can make little sparks fly in the air like tiny fireworks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or... here's an idea,\" Arraka says. \"How about you try out a spell that isn't completely useless?\""

I know you don't really like the idea, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Barry,\" Kate says. \"I know you mean no harm, and I value your friendship, but simply the thought of being experimented on again after what I went through at the Beacon as a child is-- I'm just not very keen on repeating that experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that's totally understandable,\" I say. \"My bad. I should have thought about this before making that request.\""

And casting your spells on me while my protections are still up wouldn't really be of much help to you, because you wouldn't know if they worked or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would still help me a little to cast them on you even with your protections active, but I get your point,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Barry, I didn't know you were in need of a test subject!\" Diane says. \"I'd love to help!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you... sure?\" I ask her, a little apprehensively. \"I wouldn't want you to force yourself for my sake or anything. You and Kate both grew up in the Beacon of Hope after all...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh you don't have to worry about me,\" Diane says. \"That trauma is far behind me. The idea of you testing spells on me doesn't bother me in the slightest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you're certain about it, then yeah, I could definitely use your help!\" I say. \"Thanks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Any time!\" Diane says.\r\n\r\n\"Alright, that's enough chit-chat!\" Arraka says, all of a sudden.\"We've got important business to discuss. Kate, I know you've been practicing aura manipulation in secret for the past two days. Are you ever planning to show us what you've accomplished, or are you just doing it as a hobby?\""

Daren, you can consistently use your aura to move your sword through the air nowadays, right? Why don't you make your sword float over there, so that Kate can demonstrate to us what she can do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Daren says, as he does what Arraka asked of him and makes his sword float in the air. \"Now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kate, will you do the honors?\" Arraka says.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try...\" Kate says, as she conjures an icicle in the air, coats it with her aura and then sends it flying somewhere between Daren and his floating sword.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa...\" Daren says, as he sees his sword drop to the ground in front of him. \"You did it on the first try! Congrats!\"\r\n\r\n\"See?\" Arraka tells us. \"She's a natural. And unlike Daren, I didn't even have to teach her anything. She learned it all by herself, while overhearing me give Daren his daily lessons. Now, there's one last thing that I want to test before calling it a day. Kate, why don't you get that brand new scepter of yours and cast a freezing beam on that big rock over there? But I want you to put as much energy into your beam as you can. Max it out, you understand?\""

I bet you can recover that much energy in five minutes, if you just lie down and rest for a little while. Now stop whining and do it. This is important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" Kate says, as she picks up her scepter from the ground and points it at the rock. \"I'll give it a shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, and one more thing,\" Arraka says. \"Try to shorten the casting time for your spell as much as you can. We wouldn't want to give your enemy too much of an opportunity to react and get away from your line of attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah, that rock will never know what hit it!\" Hadrik jokes, as he takes another drink of ale.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" Kate responds, and then she begins gathering an immense amount of energy at the tip of her scepter.\r\n\r\nNot even two seconds later, a beam of ice shoots out of the scepter, but the power behind it could only be compared with the flame breath that we saw Tyrath use five thousand years ago when he was still in his prime. Needless to say, the rock never stood a chance against such an attack, but even the air around us has gotten as cold as on a winter day. As we are all looking at Kate, shocked, Arraka begins to laugh very loudly, in three voices at once."

        text: "\"Aha-Ahahahahahaha!!!\" Arraka laughs. \"I knew it! I knew that this scepter wouldn't let me down! Do you know what this is? Do you KNOW what this is?! It's our secret weapon against my copy from the past, that's what! I remember exactly what defenses I used to have back then, and there's no way I could withstand something like this if I were caught unprepared. All you losers need to do is to get that cheap copy of me sufficiently distracted for two seconds, and Kate will freeze her solid! Oh man, I can't believe you idiots lucked out like this! That trip to the lessathi headquarters was worth it in so many ways!\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" Illuna asks, \"you're saying that your protection spells from five thousand years ago were so weak that you couldn't even protect against a Tyrath-level attack? Because we all saw Tyrath attacking her during the ritual, and she defended against it just fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"She didn't 'defend just fine', \"Arraka says. \"It got her sufficiently distracted for Tyrath to teleport you away from danger, which means that Kate's beam should also keep the other Arraka immobilized just long enough for us to deliver the finishing blow.\""

        text: "\"And how are we supposed to do that?\" Kate says.\r\n\r\n\"With Daren's sword, obviously,\" Arraka says. \"That weapon is so ridiculously enchanted that it can easily pass through pretty much every passive protection spell that exists today, let alone the ones that existed five thousand years ago. Even if she only gets frozen for three seconds, that should still be enough time for this buffoon to cut her in half, as long as he makes sure to stay close enough to her beforehand. The only way to defend against that sword is to either dodge it or use a powerful active protection spell against it, which she obviously won't be able to do because she'll be encased in a block of ice. Wow, this plan gets more perfect the more I think about it!\""

Other than that, some of the spells that I invented could also help, but it will depend on whether you manage to learn them or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gods be damned...\" Hadrik says, out of the blue. \"You said you had 'one last thing' to test before calling it a day, but you're still not done talking.

But I thought these were all spells that you're planning to use on your enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"At my current level of magical power, most spells that inflict pain on others would be generally worthless,\" I say. \"That's why for now, my focus needs to be on spells that either disorient my adversaries or affect their senses in some way, because that type of magic usually has some degree of utility no matter how weak the spell is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Diane says. \"That does make sense!

I have a protection against dizziness cast on me at the moment,\" Diane says. \"Should I remove it first, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that's perfect!\" I say. \"Most enemies will probably have such a protection too, so it's a good idea to do a test under these conditions as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright, then,\" Diane says. \"Whenever you're ready!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I'm done checking my notebook, I get into my stance and I cast the dizziness spell on Diane. Just as expected, her magical protection easily defends her against my attack, but it did feel like she got slightly distracted for a few seconds right after I finished casting. I wonder if the dizziness spell might have some side-effects that I'm unaware of.\r\n\r\n\"So, umm... quick question!\" Diane says. \"Was I supposed to hear a ringing in my ears when you cast the spell on me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I... can't say that I've heard this effect being described for this particular spell before,\" I say. \"But then again, the lesser known a spell is, the more chances there are for its side-effects to not be properly documented, so I'm not all that surprised. What did this ringing sound like? Was it high pitched? Were there short pauses between the ringing noises every half a second or so?\""

This is very interesting. Maybe instead of trying to give people a light headache, I could focus on fooling them into thinking that I'm trying to cast Wolford's spell on them. It feels like that might provide a better distraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, do you want me to cancel my protection against dizziness now, or?...\" Diane asks me.\r\n\r\n\"I'll just cast the spell on you one more time to make sure that the effects stay the same, and then we'll do the test without the magic protection,\" I say. \"If you don't mind, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, sure, not a problem,\" Diane says."

The dizziness spell seemed to work fine once Diane removed her protection, and she got a small headache for a few seconds, as expected. Other than that, we also tested a few illusion spells, a suggestion spell and several other spells designed primarily to distract or disorient my enemies.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, Diane has followed my instructions perfectly, without complaints of any kind. She has also kept her same playful and outgoing demeanor this whole time, although sometimes it is hard to know what she is really thinking. Unlike Kate, who will often say exactly what is on her mind, no matter how blunt or disrespectful, Diane is more the type who will try to smooth things over with a joke of some kind. However, she can also be very straightforward, impulsive and even hotheaded, depending on the situation.\r\n\r\nIf I were to take an educated guess based on what I've seen of her so far compared to how she used to act as a child during the God of Time's ritual, I'd say that the more diplomatic side of her personality is likely a result of Meridith's upbringing, whereas her occasional straightforwardness and impulsive attitude are probably traits that she used to have when she was a kid, but is now trying to suppress, because she considers them to be unwanted flaws of her personality."

However, now that you've finally had the chance to meet her and talk to her, you've realized that Diane has no intention to leave this place, and that she is working together with the lessathi of her own free will. In other words, the reason why you are conflicted right now is because you've realized that the only way for you to be able to stay with your friend after the tournament is over is to join Meridith and the rest of the lessathi, which isn't exactly the most ideal situation for you. Did I guess correctly so far?\"\r\n\r\nKate sighs.\r\n\r\n\"Only partially,\" she answers me, after a short pause. \"It's not just about what I'm going to do once the tournament is over. I'm also a little worried about Diane. She seems... changed. It's not that I was expecting her to be the exact same person that she was ten years ago, but when I talk to her now, I feel like I can't even tell what she's thinking half the time. I don't know... I suppose I just can't seem to come to terms with the fact that it was so easy to connect with Leila, despite the fact that we barely interacted while we were at the Beacon, but when it comes to Diane, it feels almost like we are strangers sometimes.\""

There's just something about her that makes her seem a little... insincere, maybe? Not that I'm calling her a liar, or anything, but sometimes I can't help but feel like I'm talking to, uh... to a female version of the king of the underground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barry, that's it!\" Kate says loudly, all of a sudden. \"I think that's what's been bothering me all this time!

I'll try to see if I can figure it out in the next few days, and maybe that will help me feel a little more comfortable talking to her!\"\r\n\r\n\"So, that's one problem partly solved,\" I say. \"But what about the other one? Have you thought about what you are going to do once the tournament ends, and Diane inevitably tells you that she wants to stay here, in Varathia, and continue to work for Meridith?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm... not sure yet,\" Kate says, as she looks to the side. \"To be frank, I've been kind of postponing that decision, knowing that we still have some time until we reach Galamir.

Essentially, they are controlling their auras so well that they can almost completely mask whether they are lying or not, and on top of that, they also like to make their auras tremble slightly at random intervals, to make it seem like they are lying even when they are telling the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interesting...\" I say. \"Do you think they're all using this as a precaution, in case they ever get interrogated by Eiden?\""

I wasn't really paying much attention to it before I noticed this with the king of the underground, but now I am gaining more and more of an interest in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, what were you two talking about before I came by?\" I say. \"You both seemed to be really enjoying yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be honest, I don't even remember what the main topic of our conversation was, and probably neither does Diane,\" Arraka says. \"We're just playing a game, she and I. A game in which the objective is for me to figure out the way in which her aura concealment works, while she plays around with me and smiles confidently, from a position of clear superiority. It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of being the underdog in any game or competition involving magic, so I'm enjoying this to my fullest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does this mean that you're not getting anywhere close to figuring her out, then?\" I ask Arraka.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she will slip up eventually, I'm sure,\" Arraka says. \"It's only a matter of time.\""

What's more, Sophie has also blended rather well with our group, and she has already made some plans to join us on a few journeys after we are done with the tournament.\r\n\r\nAside from Daren's wife, we've also been in contact with Melindra and with Leila's father, who both have transceivers from Daren and can call us whenever they like. Unfortunately, since Leila can't send her texts through the transceiver, her father needs to read them out loud for us, which makes our discussions a little awkward, but at least we can communicate with her, so I can't complain. As for Melindra, Flower tends to call her more than ten times a day, so in a way, it's like she never left. I've also seen Kate call her a few times, but she mostly does it in secret, while she is training, probably because she is too embarrassed to let us know that she misses her."

Well, actually, he mostly only talks with Arraka, and barely acknowledges our presence, but even so, he has been giving us some very interesting information about the latest developments on the magical plane. Apparently, Arraka's plan worked far better than we could have hoped, and now most of the gods have turned against the God of Time, the God of Death and the God of Fate. \r\n\r\nAlso, now that the other denizens of the magical plane found out that some of the gods had been absorbing spirits to increase their powers in secret, many of them have started volunteering to join Jirinn's enlightened warriors group and according to him, they should soon have enough members to pose an actual threat to the divided and weakened gods.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Arraka predicted, the three rogue gods have been holding out quite well against all the other gods, and they are giving no signs of losing this battle anytime soon. In fact, from what I understood, nobody has managed to even find the three gods for the past three days, probably because of the God of Fate's illusions that are doing a very good job at keeping them hidden and disorienting their foes. Still, this is very good news for us, because we want the God of Time to be as distracted and weakened as possible when we fight him, if we want to have any realistic chance of success."

Things might have gone better if I hadn't been stuck in a mountain or forced to inhabit animal bodies during the majority of my time here, but I never exactly had the opportunity to test that hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've both been to this node since Fyron took control of it, right?\" Daren asks. \"How did you convince him to share it with you?\""

If you want to visit his node while you are here, I'm certain that you can work something out with him when we'll meet him again in Galamir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Daren says, \"because he'll be there for the diplomatic discussions before the beginning of the war with Tyrath. Hopefully we'll catch him before he leaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you don't need to worry about that,\" Diane says. \"Those discussions will absolutely not start before everyone gets there, and according to Meridith, I won't be the only one who's late. You will get your chance to talk to him, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't you be the one who is worried?\" Illuna asks Diane, while raising an eyebrow. \"If they make a deal with Fyron about his node, they will have one less reason to take Meridith's deal about killing Eiden.\""

By the time we are done, Illuna has also finished washing the plates, so we put them all in Hadrik's backpack and then go on our way, heading in the direction of the nearest sacred forest.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diane, if we keep up our usual pace, we should get there at some point in the afternoon. We still haven't decided exactly what we are planning to do if the fox happens to catch us on her territory again while we're looking for pinecones, but I suppose when we have so many strong enemies already, adding one more to the list shouldn't make much of a difference.\r\n\r\nOn our way to our destination, I noticed that Diane was trying even harder than usual to be friends with everyone, probably because she was feeling bad about the whole situation with her obscuring her aura, and wanted to compensate for it. However, as expected, this only increased the suspicions of Daren and Hadrik, making most of their conversations appear very forced and unnatural. Unfortunately for her, things will likely not improve much between her and the others as long as she doesn't realize that she is sabotaging herself by acting overly-friendly like this.\r\n\r\n\"Oh gods!\" Flower exclaims, not even an hour after our departure, as she points excitedly at some very mundane-looking rock. \"Barry, do you see that?
