Can you teleport us there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on it!\" Flower says, as we are both getting enveloped by a bright white light.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are!\" Flower says.\r\n\r\nWhen I look around, I see that we're now somewhere in the sea of light called the ether, with the Overseer's green-eyed drone floating right next to us.\r\n\r\n\"Processing. Processing...\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol now understands why it couldn't find your group anywhere in the ether. Having witnessed your ability to teleport, my assumption is that you all must have teleported to a safe haven where you are undetectable. Is that correct?\""

Wait, you've been looking for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Affirmative,\" the Overseer says. \"The Overseer protocol wishes to apologize for the inconvenience it has caused. Your souls were not meant to be teleported outside of your minds along with the rebels' souls. Unfortunately, the technique I used was still experimental, and it ended up affecting the whole area of the battlefield instead of targeting only our common enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem!\" Flower says. \"Everyone's fine now. So anyway, we wanted to ask you if you'd like to fight Peter and the king of the underground together with us here, on the ethereal plane. I could teleport us to them right now if you want!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Overseer protocol accepts your offer,\" the green-eyed drone says. \"That was the destination that I was heading to as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" Flower says. \"Get ready, then. We're teleporting in three... two... one...\""

Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep,\" I say, and then we both get enveloped by the usual bright light that appears when you are getting teleported.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" I suddenly hear the voice of Peter, once we are done teleporting to our new location, in the middle of the ether.\r\n\r\nWhen I turn to look towards Peter, who was somewhere around twenty feet away from us, I see that the king of the underground was also there, like Flower said, and he had already created a body for himself in the ethereal plane. As I get a better look at the two of them, I notice the fact that Peter's eyes are not shining brightly like Flower's, which means that he must not have experienced the same evolution that would allow him to teleport over long distances and to detect souls on the ethereal plane no matter where they are.\r\n\r\n\"Take a wild guess,\" I answer Peter."

While my head is filled with hundreds of possible combinations of spells, I can slowly feel the cold creeping in, until my whole body is trembling uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Flower attempts to get us out of the box a few times, but she just can't concentrate enough to cast her teleportation spell, and the ever-increasing coldness in the air is only making it harder for her to stay awake.

What obligation do we have to save their lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"They may have been our enemies in this fight, but that does not negate all the help that their group has given us in our time of need,\" the king of the underground says. \"At least wake them up before we leave. Give them a chance to defend themselves from... whatever this is!\"\r\n\r\n\"As you wish, my lord,\" Peter says. \"But I will only wake the little girl up. The other one may know of a way to cancel my teleportation, and I do not want to risk it.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after their talk, I hear the sound of their bodies vibrating loudly as they are teleporting away, and then there is only silence for a while.

While my head is filled with hundreds of possible combinations of spells, I can slowly feel the cold creeping in, until my whole body is trembling uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Flower attempts to get us out of the box a few times, but she just can't concentrate enough to cast her teleportation spell, and the ever-increasing coldness in the air is only making it harder for her to stay awake. Eventually, we both succumb to the freezing cold, and we lose our consciousness."

Is this guy seriously using my own technique against me? Oh, he's going to regret this.\r\n\r\n\"What are you blabbering about?\" Peter asks me, having apparently heard my thoughts. \"What do you mean 'your own technique'? If you were trying to distract me, you should have gone with a lie that was a bit more credible.\"\r\n\r\nAh, crap. I forgot to think without words again. I'd better make sure to think faster from now on, or I'll give away all of my plans to him.\r\n\r\nOkay, so the way I see it, this technique has one major weakness, which is the fact that you need to figure out what your enemy is casting very quickly, so that you can do all of the movements in reverse and somehow still finish them fast enough to counter your opponent's spell. Due to this fact, multi-step dispelling is particularly vulnerable to feints.\r\n\r\nOh, boy... I really hope I didn't think all that out loud, or I'll be making a complete fool of myself."

I am just so tired. The only thing I want to do now is go back to sleep."

Barry!!!\"\r\n\r\nFlower's screams are nothing more than background noise to me now. As soon as my body from the ethereal plane becomes completely transparent, the fatigue disappears, and it is replaced with a feeling of calm, as I quickly begin to lose any sense of who I am or what I had been doing until a few moments prior, and I can feel myself melding with the light around me, while my consciousness is slowly fading away.\r\n\r\nAt long last, it is over. At long last, I can rest."

As I predicted, the king avoids using his semi-transparent box when he sees us so close to him, and he tries to use his aura manipulation to push us away instead.\r\n\r\nFlower, however does not give the king of the underground the time to use his technique, and she shoots a beam of fire at him, thus forcing him to focus all of his efforts on reinforcing the aura shield around himself. In the meantime, I also take advantage of their confusion to strike Peter with the lightning spell that I used before on the king."

After thinking things over for a short while, I realized that you are for all intents and purposes a mage and a generalist in this realm, and maybe I should start treating you as such. Tell me, Barry, have you ever seen a fight between Brinhorn and Azarius?\""

I don't care if you actually were that man's apprentice or not. The point I was trying to make is that whenever two generalists fight, they have a certain way of doing battle that is not comparable to any other kinds of mage fights. Do you know what I'm talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, yeah, it would have been pretty hard to not see the difference,\" I say.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" Peter says. \"I only had the opportunity to see one of their duels, due to how insanely hard it is to obtain permission to leave Varathia as an Ollendor citizen, but that one duel will remain imprinted in my mind forever.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Peter is talking, I can slowly feel the whole world beginning to spin around me, as if I'd just gulped down an entire bottle of dwarven ale.\r\n\r\n\"As a former apprentice of Brinhorn, I'm sure that you will immediately recognize the famous battle that I am about to recreate before your eyes. Let us see if you can live up to your old mentor's teachings.\""

Why does it look like he's controlling some of those fireballs manually? The whole point of this spell is that the fireballs are supposed to follow their target on their own, so that you can continue to cast other spells while your enemy is distracted. Normally, Peter should have no business directing any of the projectiles.\r\n\r\nBut what if...\r\n\r\nWhat if this isn't his previous spell at all?... What if he just used his ethereal powers to create a bunch of fireballs out of nothing, in the same way that Flower made that palm tree and turned it into a cart?\r\n\r\nOf course... If I think about it like this, then it all makes sense!\r\n\r\nMy dispelling did work! He's just trying to fool me into thinking that it didn't, so that I won't try to interrupt him and make him lose his focus on all these dozens of fireballs that he is controlling individually.\r\n\r\nThis is it.

I should have known that this would be a trick from the very beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are testing my patience...\" Peter says. \"You don't want me to use my actual powerful spells against you in this realm.

Recalling the exact spells that Brinhorn cast to get himself out of this situation in one of his duels against Azarius, I begin by making flames come out of my hands, and then I use my palms like hot irons to burn both of my cheeks for a few seconds.

At a certain point, he's bound to deviate from the original fight in some way and maybe it would be better if I made the first move rather than-- okay, never mind, too late for that. Peter is now diving straight for me in his manticore form. Azarius never did anything like this against Brinhorn. \r\n\r\nIs he going to transform back into his human form and cast a spell at me once he gets closer?... No, no, no, the shapeshifting process can't be done instantly, and it would leave him too vulnerable. Then is he planning to attack me while he's in his manticore form instead? Something doesn't add up, here. This has to be one of his traps again! I can feel it... I think he's trying to goad me into attacking him. Let's see if he'll reveal his cards to me if I play along a little.\r\n\r\nI get into a stance and I pretend that I'm about to cast a short-range paralysis spell on him as soon as he gets closer. Okay, this should be convincing enough. Come on, Peter, show me what you're--\r\n\r\nBefore I even get to finish my thought process, the image of the manticore in front of me disappears, and it is replaced by Peter, who had apparently never shapeshifted in the first place, and only used illusion magic to make me think that he did. Just as he casts a paralysis spell of his own, I use my air currents to dash away from him and to narrowly avoid his attack."

I do not give him the opportunity to summon new manticores and I rain down a swarm of fire arrows on him, forcing him to fly away from his position.

The headache is nowhere near as bad as the one that I got from the botched teleportation when I was transported to the underground caverns with Leila, but that's not really saying much. This is still much worse than any hangover I've ever had, and it's greatly affecting my concentration.\r\n\r\nOf all the things that could have gotten the best of me, it just had to be poison... It's a good thing that Illuna isn't here, or I'd never hear the end of it.\r\n\r\nI waste no time and I blow the poison cloud away with a gust of wind. The harm has already been done, but at least now it won't get any worse than it already is. Now where is Peter hiding?... I assumed that he would try to use the mist as cover to take me by surprise, but he is nowhere in sight. Don't tell me that he used the poison cloud just to run away?..."

          the poison will sink in, and you will lose all of your senses one by

          lose, followed by your sense of smell and then your sight. I am only
          giving you this warning because of what little respect I still have
          left for you as a fellow generalist. If you still have any secret
          techniques that you were saving up until the last moment, then I

I might have completely forgotten about it if you hadn't mentioned it, so thank you for that!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you still think you can defeat me, then you'd better do it now,\" Peter says. \"Soon, you won't even be able to tell where I am anymore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, I think I might have a better idea!\" I say. \"Why don't I hold on to this secret technique for a while longer, to keep you on the edge? This strategy seems to have been working wonders so far!\"\r\n\r\nPeter does not answer me and I can't see the reaction on his face since he's still invisible, but if I were to guess, I'd say that he's probably pretty pissed right now. The fact that he specifically brought up the idea of me revealing my secret techniques made his previous 'advice' seem very suspicious to me. He's clearly trying to bait me, here. If this poison were really meant to get worse over time, he would have tried to stall me instead of telling me to attack him. There really was no reason for him to tell me about all of this unless...\r\n\r\nUnless his poison is only temporary and he never bothered to learn any poison spells with long lasting effects! Yes, that has to be it! Now that I'm paying some more attention to my headache and nausea, it does kind of feel like it's getting better, even though the improvement is subtle. Let's see if I can buy a little more time by taking advantage of his unfounded cautiousness around me."

Please refrain from taking such rash actions in the future if you do not want to put any more unnecessary strain on our already fragile alliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duly noted,\" I tell the Overseer.\r\n\r\n\"So, what are you going to tell Daren, then?...\" Flower says. \"I thought we both promised him that we'd try our best to keep all casualties to a minimum.\""

Nice work, Barry!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Flower was talking, I was busy conjuring two large stone plates on opposite sides of the king of the underground's head, positioning them approximately six feet away from him in both directions. Once I was done with that, I did the same thing for Peter, with two additional stone plates.\r\n\r\n\"Umm, Barry?...\" Flower asks, looking a little nervous. \"What are you planning to do with those rocks?...\"\r\n\r\nI ignore Flower and I raise my hands, taking control of both pairs of stone plates at the same time. Then, before Flower has the time to say anything else, I clap my hands as hard as I can and the two pairs of stone plates close in on each other at breathtaking speeds, turning the heads of both rebels into a thick red paste upon collision.\r\n\r\n\"NO!!!\" Flower shouts, as she instinctively flies towards the dead bodies, even if she probably already realized that there's nothing she can do to help them anymore.\r\n\r\nShe cancels her fire jets a few seconds later when she comes back to her senses, and then she just stares at the lifeless bodies in front of her for a short while before she speaks again."

We could have easily captured them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Captured them how?\" I ask. \"Both of them could use powerful techniques without moving, so it's not like we could have just tied them up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know!\" Flower says. \"We could have asked the Overseer to put them in an anti-magic prison cell or something! Wasn't that one of the main reasons why we allied ourselves with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been too risky,\" I say. \"We barely managed to beat them this one time. If they escaped from their cells, there was no guarantee that we could have beaten them again. Killing them was the only way to make sure that we wouldn't need to fight them anymore.\""

        text: "Just as I'm about to open my eyes, I remember Flower's warning from before she teleported me.\r\n\r\n\"--no matter what-- open your eyes!\" were the words I heard her saying.\r\n\r\nThe phrase is not complete, but based on the structure of the sentence it feels like she was saying something along the lines of \"no matter what, don't open your eyes\".\r\n\r\nI can't be sure of this, but she did tell me that I should keep visualizing the cube, and she never told me when to stop. I still have the image of the cube in front of me right now, so I guess I should probably keep thinking of it. This is the only thing I should be worrying about. Nothing else matters. Just keep imagining the cube.\r\n\r\nA whole minute passes without me doing anything other than concentrating on the image of the sanctuary which I have in my head. Or at least I think it's been a minute. It's kind of hard to keep track of time in this complete darkness.\r\n\r\nIt's fine. There's no need to open my eyes. I'm still conscious for now, and this is all that matters. A minute ago, I could have sworn that I only had a few seconds left to live, but somehow I'm still here. I'm still awake. Whatever Flower did, it must have had at least some positive effect, or else I wouldn't be alive."

        text: "As I'm still waiting for something to happen, I suddenly feel myself being drenched from head to toe in freezing cold water, and when I instinctively jump up, I quickly realize that there is now ground beneath my feet, and it no longer feels like I'm floating in an endless darkness like before. The rain is pouring down my cheeks, a sound of lightning echoes in the distance, and the wind is still blowing, although not as hard as it did at the beginning of the storm.\r\n\r\nIs this it?... Am I finally back on the earthen plane for good?\r\n\r\n\"Are you planning to open your eyes anytime soon, or are you expecting me to talk to you like this?...\" I hear Flower's voice, speaking in Illuna's tone.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally open my eyelids, I see that Flower is standing before me with flaming eyes in this plane of existence as well, except that the flames are blue, because Illuna is the one who is talking. Her body is not made up of flames like in the ethereal plane, however.\r\n\r\nEvery connection that I had with the ethereal plane is now gone. Even though I'm trying to switch my consciousness to the other realm, it's not working anymore. Could this be the result of my soul finally returning to my sanctuary on the ethereal plane?"

        text: "\"There was this... darkness,\" I tell Illuna. \"It felt similar to the void that the Magium made me float around in when it almost erased me from the world, except this time I still had my memories and my identity left intact. Wait, no, that's not right... There was also something else different about this... nothingness that I was in. I didn't really get to see it because I had my eyes closed the whole time, but the darkness around me seemed almost... oppressive. Like it was trying to swallow me whole. Do you have any idea what might have happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, so that's what Flower did,\" Illuna says. \"I had some pretty strong suspicions, but I could barely get any kind of coherent information out of her through our telepathic link when I talked to her earlier. I should probably let her know that she didn't end up killing you by accident before she gives herself a heart attack out of pure anxiety.\"\r\n\r\n\"She thought she might have killed me?...\" I ask, in an uneasy tone. \"Wait, what did she do?\"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering me, Illuna raises two fingers in the air in front of me, signaling me to be quiet while she talks to Flower telepathically in the ethereal plane. Once she is done, she lowers her hand so that we can resume our conversation."

The ether was the one attacking you, so Flower decided to teleport you in the only place where you'd be truly safe from it.

Seeing that you were no longer breathing on the earthen plane, I assumed that you had failed at your task, so I had to get a little creative.\"\r\n\r\nShe then holds out her palm and conjures a floating sphere of water above it, hinting that she was the reason why the water that I was drenched in was three times colder than the rain drops from the storm.\r\n\r\n\"Wow...\" I tell her. \"I don't know what to say. Thank you. And Flower. I have no idea what would have happened if you two hadn't intervened the way you did.
