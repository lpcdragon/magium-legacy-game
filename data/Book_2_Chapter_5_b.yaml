I don't see what other tricks they could pull out of their sleeve this late in the game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" Leila writes. \"You don't see any way in which the organizers could guarantee your death in the next round?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a one,\" I tell her. \r\n\r\n\"Alright, then,\" Leila writes, simply.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, the announcer receives a written list from a member of the organizing team, and after glancing over it for a few seconds, he begins to read it aloud.\r\n\r\n\"I am now going to announce the names of the gladiators that will be fighting in the first duel,\" the announcer says. \"This will be a fight to the death. The gladiators will need to battle until only one of them is left alive. No surrendering is allowed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get ready,\" Leila writes to me.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for what?\" I ask her.\r\n\r\n\"The name of the gladiators are--\" the announcer says, as he gets ready to read the first line on the parchment."

I've gotten through every obstacle in my path so far. There's no reason why this should be any different. So there's no need to panic, okay? No reason. Just need to calm down. No panic. No panic...\r\n\r\nWhile I'm busy thinking to myself, Daren is also slowly advancing towards me, only he seems to be unusually calm about all of this. Why is that? Is it because he knows he can beat me? No, no, that can't be the reason. Could it be that he already managed to figure a way out of this mess? What is he planning to do, exactly? Damn it, I'm sure that I could come up with a plan too, if only I could manage to calm down!\r\n\r\nOnce Daren and I both get to the center of the arena, facing each other, Daren gives me a wide grin, he drops his sword and shield on the ground, and then he throws his hands in the air."

How could I?\"\r\n\r\n\"This fight is to the death, healer,\" the announcer says. \"Even if this man is your friend--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, look at those muscles!\" Daren shouts loudly, interrupting the announcer. \"No sane man would ever dare fight such a beast!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly all of the spectators in the crowd burst into laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Those arms look like he could smash my head like a watermelon between his bare hands!\" Daren continues, with a mocking grin on his face. \"And look at the size of his back! May the gods have mercy on my soul!\"\r\n\r\nLaugh it up, Daren... \r\n\r\nStill, I have to give credit where credit is due. The idea to surrender was genius. Genius, and yet so obvious. How did I not think of this?\r\n\r\nWhile the crowds are still laughing, the ambassador of Ollendor is making his way into the fighting area through one of the iron gates, and he is heading towards us.\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" the ambassador shouts, and the crowds slowly fall silent. \"Why aren't you fighting? This is a fight to the death! You can't just surrender!\""

You were never meant to walk out of here alive! Do you hear me? This whole arena was nothing but a farce! Don't make the mistake of thinking that you have any chance of survival just because you've won two measly rounds. I am the ambassador of Ollendor! If I wanted, I could have you both executed right now, in front of all these people, and nobody would bat an eye! That is how much power I have! Now hurry up and kill each other like the dogs you are, or I will have your heads placed on spikes, along with all of your friends!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the ambassador was talking, the murmurs from the crowd started to slowly turn into booing that only intensified the more the ambassador spoke. By the time he finished his monologue, most of the spectators had picked up the booing, and they were getting louder by the second.\r\n\r\n\"Off with the ambassador's head!\" shouts one of the spectators, loudly enough for everyone to hear him.\r\n\r\nThis one phrase seemed to have perfectly resonated with what everyone was thinking at that moment, because all the spectators in the crowd gradually picked it up and made a shorter version of it, in order to be able to chant it in unison, repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\"Off with his head! Off with his head! Off with his head!\" the crowds keep chanting, as the ambassador's arrogant look on his face slowly gets replaced with a much darker and more fearful expression, while a trickle of sweat begins to run down his forehead."

Eiden?\" the ambassador says, as he looks around, trying to identify the source of the sound.\r\n\r\n\"How does it feel to have so many people threatening to end your life at the same time?\" Eiden says. \"Take a good look at these people, ambassador. Do you think that they would care about your high rank if you met them now on the street? Do you think that they would hesitate to kill you, even for a moment, if they were given the chance to do so?\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses.\r\n\r\n\"These are the people that you've shunned all of your life, ambassador,\" Eiden continues. \"And you have done so due to your strict adherence to the belief that all of the people below your social rank were nothing but inferior creatures, unworthy of your attention. Do you still have what it takes to stick to your beliefs now, and face the direct consequences of your actions? What choice will you make, ambassador? Your time is running out.\""

The solution, however, never came.\r\n\r\n\"I've changed my mind!\" the ambassador says, finally, loudly enough so that the spectators can hear him. \"We will follow the rules! These two gladiators have now become undesirables. If they survive the final round, then they will be set free, as promised. You may continue the rest of the round as you see fit.\"\r\n\r\nHe then storms out of the fighting area, and as far away from the booing noises as his legs can carry him. In the meantime, Daren has picked up his sword and shield from the ground, and he is now looking towards the place where we've heard Eiden's voice coming from.\r\n\r\n\"So, how's it going, Eiden?\" Daren says. \"Are you enjoying the show?\"\r\n\r\nThe empty place that Daren is addressing gives him no answer.\r\n\r\n\"You know, I was thinking...\" Daren says, ignoring the fact that Eiden never answered his question. \"While I was travelling, I've often heard of these new types of circuses, where they involve their audience directly in some parts of their shows. I was thinking that since you're such a loyal spectator, maybe we could try some of that! What do you think?\""

The sword passes through the empty space where the stillwater had been standing, and it falls on the ground, a few dozen feet beyond that position. Looking a bit disappointed, Daren lets out a small sigh, and he goes to retrieve his sword. \r\n  \r\nNot long after the departure of the ambassador, the announcer officially ends the fight between me and Daren, and he declares me as the victor of the battle, due to Daren's surrender. As I am preparing to return to my division room, the announcer stops me, telling me that I was scheduled to fight to the death with a gladiator from the sixth division right after my battle with Daren. The announcer also reminds me that as an undesirable, I now have the right to refuse to fight until the penalty round, if I so desire."

As the man enters the fighting area, I recognize him as being one of the more proficient fighters in his group. Actually, I'd even go as far as saying that he is comparable in terms of combat prowess to the fighters from the first division. His build is also quite impressive, being as tall as Daren and as bulky as Bruce. Just like most of the other gladiators, he seems to be wearing leather armor, but instead of a sword, his weapon of choice appears to be a large double-edged battle-axe, which he is now holding in both hands.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the fight will likely be announced as soon as he reaches me. Now, then... How do I go about this? The fight is to the death, but as an undesirable, I am no longer bound by such rules. If I want him out of the way, killing him would be easier, but technically I could also just break one of his legs or something, and it should be enough for my intents and purposes."

Flower makes sure to stop her fireballs when she sees him, and as soon as Hadrik positions himself above Tyrath, he turns back into his usual dwarf form, making a dive towards the dragon and punching him in the back. Hadrik's punch was so strong that we heard it from all the way down here, and it sent the dragon flying a dozen feet towards the ground.

Couldn't you come back later, after I've learned how to activate them?\" \r\n\r\n\"If you're not planning to activate the stats,\" the dragon says, \"then I'm going to start by slowly murdering all of your friends, one by one, until you finally come to your senses. And once I'm done with you, I will destroy this entire city, and then I will burn all the other human settlements from this continent to the ground. I will do today what I should have done ten thousand years ago. Your race was never meant to get out of the caves.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after he finishes his speech, a very large explosion envelops the dragon, and then a few smaller explosions start to fill the area around him. Flower, who is now high up in the sky, some two hundred feet away from the dragon, makes a victory gesture with her right fist, as soon as she sees the explosions."

Flower makes sure to stop her fireballs when she sees him, and as soon as Hadrik positions himself above Tyrath, he turns back into his usual dwarf form, making a dive towards the dragon and punching him in the back. Hadrik's punch was so strong that we heard it from all the way down here, and it sent the dragon flying a dozen feet towards the ground. The dwarf then turns back into an eagle, and he flies away, waiting to see what his opponent will do next."

        text: "The dragon looks furious. It seems that he's planning to go all out from the start, this time around. Before Flower gets to cast a new fireball, the dragon disappears from where he was previously, and he reappears right in front of her, slashing at her with one of his claws. Flower reacts immediately, and she uses a jet of fire from her left hand to push her to the side, and out of the dragon's reach. Tyrath wastes no time, and he teleports again, right behind Flower. This time, it is Illuna who quickly turns around, and she uses two water jets from her hands to attack the dragon and also to push herself away from him at the same time. While the girl and the dragon repeat the same motions a few more times, Kate is preparing a very large cone of ice in the air above her, getting ready to send it flying towards Tyrath.\r\n\r\n\"Kate, this isn't going to work,\" Daren tells her, as he sees her preparing her ice cone. \"Don't you remember how things went the last time we've fought him? Your ice cones didn't affect him at all. If you could use one of your ice platforms to fly me all the way into the sky, maybe I could manage to hurt him with my sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"This won't be like the last time,\" Kate says, with a determined look on her face. \"Now that I know the full extent of my enemy's power, I no longer have the luxury to worry about conserving my magical energy. This time, I'm going to fight him with all I've got, even if I end up fainting from exhaustion.\""

        text: "\"Damn it, listen to me!\" Daren says, but Kate ignores him, and she surrounds herself in a cage made of ice that she then uses to lift her up in the sky, so she can get a better view of her target.\r\n\r\nThe cone of ice that she's creating is definitely looking a lot different from anything she's ever made before. It looks as sharp and durable as elven steel, and it is simply radiating magical energy. It feels like the whole area around it is trembling from the magical power that is being pumped into that one ice cone, and once the creation process is complete, the cone starts turning by itself, following the dragon's movements. After Tyrath teleports a few more times in order to attack Flower, Hadrik finally catches up to him again, in his eagle form, and he turns into a dwarf once more, punching him right in the face."

There is an extremely powerful explosion of air behind the ice cone, as it gets sent straight into the dragon's chest at an incredible speed. The icicle penetrates Tyrath's tough hide, and he lets out a very loud roar, which almost makes everyone lose their consciousness, even while they are desperately trying to cover their ears. The dragon then yanks the ice cone out of his chest with his claw, and he teleports right next to Kate, who is now barely even able to stand on her feet, inside her floating ice cage, due to the dragon's roar from before. Just as the dragon is about to burn her alive with his fire breath, a golden cage appears out of nowhere, trapping him inside. This does not stop Tyrath from breathing his fire, but somehow, none of the flames manage to pass through the cage's bars, and they eventually die out by themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The fox's cage...\" Tyrath says.\r\n\r\nHe then turns around, looking straight at Illuna.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your doing?\" he asks her.\r\n\r\n\"I've had enough of your annoying teleporting,\" Illuna says. \"You are going to stay put for the next few minutes. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"How is this going to help you in any way?\" Tyrath says. \"I may not be able to attack you from inside here, but neither can you.

Kate is now also creating as many of her newly designed ice cones as she can, although judging by the expression on her face, this process is definitely wearing her out much faster than her usual means of casting magic. I don't know if she can keep this up much longer.\r\n\r\nDamn it, there has to be something I can do in this situation. Maybe I can find a way to get up there somehow."

In the meantime, some other people are pushing several flying machines into the arena's fighting area. The machines look similar to the flying contraptions built by gnomes, with a large propeller on top, a long tail in the back, and two wings that help with gliding through the air. The propeller is usually powered by a spell cast by an air elementalist, but aside from that, there is no further need for magic in order to help these machines fly.\r\n\r\nI used to know a gnome a few years ago who would keep making me do flight tests of his prototypes in exchange for the information I needed about mages. I remember one of those prototypes being so bad that the propeller actually stopped working while I was in mid-flight, and I had to glide all the way down. I still have nightmares about some of those flights even to this day.\r\n\r\nOne of the people that pushed the flying contraptions into the arena is now having an argument with a gnome, not very far from our position.

Visibly upset, the dragon begins to rain down flames upon them, trying to dispose of them all at once. Luckily, Daren had already reached the spectator area a while ago, and as soon as he sees the flames, he uses his shield to create a large semi-transparent barrier, which defends all of the soldiers from the fire attack.\r\n\r\nI think I'm finally starting to understand how the dragon's fire breathing works. It seems that he needs to inhale a great deal of air in his lungs before he attacks, and he also never exhales the fire right away afterwards. I'm guessing that this is because he first needs to ignite the fire, before breathing it out. This means that as long as you pay attention to his breathing, you should be able to tell when he'll attack you with fire, and you'll have all the time you need to dodge his flames, if you are fast enough."

Of course, this does not make us invulnerable, and I'm not sure how long the shields can hold against flames that are as hot as the dragon's, so we should try evading his fire breath as much as possible.\"\r\n\r\nAs we reach a high enough level of altitude, the golden cage surrounding the dragon is slowly starting to fade.\r\n\r\n\"Get ready,\" the gnome tells me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cage disappears, all of Flower's fireballs explode at the same time, sending a very powerful gust of wind towards us, and Kate's ice cones also get launched into the dragon soon afterwards. The protections that Tyrath cast on himself during all this time help him to survive the damage, but it's clear that he didn't get out of that unscathed. What's more, the amount of damage that he needed to absorb with his magical shields also seems to have drained him of his magical energy for the time being, because he is no longer using teleportation to move around and has gone back to using his wings to fly."

            paragraph: 26
            text: "Almost as soon as he gets away from all the explosions, the dragon uses his fire breath to attack Kate. He was rather far from her when he attacked, however, which gave Kate enough time to move her ice cage out of the way, before the flames reached her. Tyrath now attempts to make a dive towards her, but before he reaches his target, the king's soldiers activate their strange weapons in unison, and they release a very powerful bolt of lightning that hits him head on. Visibly upset, the dragon begins to rain down flames upon them, trying to dispose of them all at once. Luckily, Daren had already reached the spectator area a while ago, and as soon as he sees the flames, he uses his shield to create a large semi-transparent barrier, which defends all of the soldiers from the fire attack.\r\n\r\nI think I'm finally starting to understand how the dragon's fire breathing works. It seems that he needs to inhale a great deal of air in his lungs before he attacks, and he also never exhales the fire right away afterwards. I'm guessing that this is because he first needs to ignite the fire, before breathing it out. This means that as long as you pay attention to his breathing, you should be able to tell when he'll attack you with fire, and you'll have all the time you need to dodge his flames, if you are fast enough.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" I tell Golmyck. \"I think I just found out one of the dragon's weaknesses. He always needs to inhale a lot of air in his lungs before he can use a fire attack. He also needs to wait a second or two for the fire to ignite, before he can breathe it out. As long as you pay attention to his breathing, you should be able to anticipate when he's going to shoot fire at you.\""

            text: "\"Nice catch,\" Golmyck says. \"I will definitely keep that in mind, while I pilot the aircraft.\"\r\n\r\nTyrath seems to have changed his mind again, and he's now chasing after Hadrik, who is currently in his eagle form. Even with Hadrik's speed, it still seems like the dragon is going to catch up to him soon. Maybe now would be a good time to make use of those acid coated bullets?"

Tyrath now soars back into the sky, looking more menacing than ever before.\r\n\r\n\"This is all my fault,\" Tyrath says, in an unusually calm tone. \"I alone am to blame for having given you the illusion that you could actually stand a chance against me. I am now going to fix that mistake. Instead of continuing to fight you individually, I will simply destroy this whole city and everyone in it with a single spell. This way, there will be no more misunderstandings.\""

According to the pact, neither of the three of us are allowed to directly attack any of the other's followers. This is to avoid a fight breaking out between any of the three signing parties, because a fight between any two of us would have the potential of destroying the entire island before reaching its conclusion, and neither of us would want that. As such, any and all conflicts between the three of us are to be resolved indirectly through our followers, and not through any direct means, whatsoever.\""

        text: "\"Ridiculous,\" Tyrath says. \"That old pact has long ago lost its meaning. The only reason why we signed the pact in the first place was because our powers used to be comparable. That has no longer been the case for more than a hundred years. Ever since you left the continent, you've only grown weaker, and now you are but an empty shell of your former self. If you didn't always resort to petty tricks, I would have killed you a century ago. You are no longer a threat, stillwater, and therefore, our pact is now void.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" Eiden asks, with a wide smile. \"Well, let us declare a new pact, then!\"\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, the air all around us starts to feel like it's weighing heavily on our shoulders, and the world itself seems like it is trembling. It's almost as if there was now an earthquake in the middle of the air, instead of the earth below, and the blue sky looks as if it is ready to crack any minute, under the pressure. I realize immediately that this is the direct result of Eiden unleashing his magical aura, and that this may well not even be the true extent of his power.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" I hear Arraka talking from somewhere behind us. \"I see that Eiden has finally decided to get a little bit serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little bit?\" Illuna shouts at her, in disbelief.\r\n\r\n\"We never really got to name our old pact,\" Eiden tells Tyrath, \"but we could call this new one 'The pact of the Creator's return'. What do you say, old friend? Will our words be enough this time, or should I get a pen and paper?\""

But know that my purpose remains unchanged. If I cannot destroy all the human cities myself, then my armies will just have to do it for me. I will not rest until every single one of these cities is burned down, whether that takes me weeks or years to accomplish. The next time you will be seeing me will be after I've destroyed everything that you've once loved and cherished in this godforsaken world. Remember this.\"   \r\n\r\nAs Tyrath turns to leave, Eiden calls out to him one last time.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention,\" Eiden says, with a polite smile. \"The mages that have joined the tournament will also temporarily be classified as my followers under the terms of our pact. They are our esteemed guests after all. Therefore, you are not to bring harm to any of them until the end of the tournament, unless, of course, they attack you first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmph,\" Tyrath says. \"I will keep that in mind.\""

Did Eiden just cast a silencing spell?\r\n\r\nEiden then turns towards the soldiers from the king's army, who are all looking at him as if they've seen a ghost. Eiden's smile widens when he sees them, and he decides to give them a parting message before he leaves.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you all standing there for?\" Eiden asks the soldiers. \"Go on, spread the news!
