Didn't you come here as a participant in this tournament?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was born here, but I didn't spend my whole life here. It is not so easy to return here once you've left, however. I used this tournament as a means to come back, because I have some unfinished business to attend to.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm guessing this unfinished business of yours is somehow related to this thing you want me to look at.\"\r\n\r\nShe doesn't make any comment, but her silence is enough to confirm my hypothesis.

What these spells do is that they insert an idea inside your head, and they make you think you were the one that came up with it.

When we reach our destination, we notice everything is completely silent, and there's a lot of dead bodies in our way. Once we get within eyeshot of Kate, we start to understand why there are no noises coming from the battlefield. Kate is sitting on her knees, with her head bowed down, and both of her hands holding the hilt of an ice sword thrust into the ground. Both Kate and her ice sword are full of blood, and the ground all around her is littered with dead bodies. As she hears us approach, she raises her head slightly to look at us and says:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, where are my manners? I should have left at least a few survivors for the two of you.\"\r\n\r\nAs she finishes her sentence, she lets go of her sword and falls face first on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Kate!!!\" shouts Daren as he rushes to her side. He starts casting his healing spell, but he appears to be having difficulties. After a few minutes, he finishes his spell, but Kate still hasn't woken up, and some of her wounds have not closed.\r\n\r\n\"This kind of damage isn't going to just disappear with a simple healing spell,\" Daren says. \"She'll need quite some time to fully recover.

Closing in on them with a melee weapon when they've all got crossbows seems almost suicidal.\r\n\r\nBut speed is all I've got. I'm not confident enough to shoot my crossbow while moving, and if I stop for even a second, I'll get a crossbow bolt through my skull. I have to make it work. First of all, I need to single them out. I can't fight them all at once.\r\n\r\nI use my superior agility to quickly distance myself from them, and make sure that they've completely lost my trace. I then start shooting my crossbow at several trees that are far apart from each other, in order to distract my attackers. A few of them take the bait, and get closer, to investigate the source of the sound.\r\n\r\nThese are not trained soldiers. At best, they could be some lowly personal guards. There's no way an organized group would ever break their formation because of a cheap trick like this."

Before the second one even has the time to figure out what's going on, I kill him as well, and then I hide behind the next tree. Fortunately, the other crossbowmen are too focused at what they're doing and haven't noticed that their allies have been taken out. \r\n\r\nThis is perfect. It means I still have time to take out another group before they realize what's going on. I see my next targets, cautiously advancing towards one of the trees I shot earlier. There's three of them this time. I'd better be careful.\r\n\r\nJust like before, I wait for a moment when they're all with their backs at me, I arrive behind them almost instantly, and before they have the chance to realize what's going on, two of them are already dead. The third one, however, managed to dodge my hit, and is now trying to aim his crossbow at my stomach."

One slash of my dagger is all it takes to take care of him.\r\n\r\nTwo of the other men saw what happened, and are rushing towards their fallen comrades. I take advantage of this to quickly circle around them, and I take them out without giving them any chance to retaliate. I take out two others just as easily, and in the end, there's only one man still left standing. Seeing what happened to his comrades, he abandons his post and makes a run for it, trying to get as far away from the battlefield as possible.\r\n\r\nHe might be fast, but he cannot escape my sight. I aim my crossbow for him, and shoot him in the back of the head, killing him instantly."

I then wield it as a club, and use it to smash his head into the nearest rooted tree. As I lift my oversized club to gaze upon my attacker, I notice that nothing remains of the man's head, except for the red paste splattered on the trees.\r\n \r\nThe other four men start screaming their lungs out. One of them is in such a hurry to leave that he trips and falls, another one literally pissed his pants, and the other two are running away as fast as their legs can carry them, and as far away from the battlefield as possible."

I start moving more cautiously, making sure I get a clear view of my enemies before getting detected. I manage to avoid any resistance until I reach their leader's location. He's only got a handful of guards surrounding him. He was definitely not expecting an ambush. \r\n\r\nI take my time to silently neutralize all of the enemy's forces that are within hearing range of their leader, and then I quickly take out his personal guards, before they get the time to react. Their leader just realized what happened and is now screaming like a little girl. By the looks of his fancy garments, he appears to be some rich noble from one of the more prosperous cities of the west. That would explain how he could motivate so many people to follow him on this suicide mission.\r\n\r\n\"W-W-What are you doing here?\" he asks. \"How did you get here? Guards? Guards!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody's coming to help you. All of the crossbowmen in hearing range of you have been taken care of. It's just you and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"N-N-No! Don't come closer. Stay back!\"\r\n\r\nI grab him by the tunic, to make sure I have his undivided attention.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me. I don't care what country you're from, or how you got so many men to follow you here, but you are my hostage now. If you don't tell all of your troops to step out of the forest, drop their weapons and surrender, I am going to murderer you right here and now, and then I'll do the same to all of your guards.\""

I think my trigger finger may be slipping.\"\r\n\r\nHe reluctantly puts the voice magnifier to his mouth, and calls out to his troops.\r\n\r\n\"Attention, all men! This is the duke of Bagelberry speaking. I have just been captured by the enemy. I repeat, I have just been captured by the enemy. You are all to step out of the forest, throw down your weapons and surrender!\"\r\n\r\nThe forest falls silent, as the crossbowmen's relentless attacks towards Kate suddenly come to a halt. They are confused, that much I can tell.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you hear me?! As your ruler, I COMMAND you to come out of that forest and drop your weapons! Now!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a small delay, the first couple of crossbowmen start stepping out of the shadows, followed by a wave of a few dozen more men. Eventually they all step out of the forest, and throw their weapons at Kate's feet, declaring their surrender.\r\n\r\n\"There, I did what you asked!\" says the duke. \"Now will you let me go?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why would I do that? The way I remember it, all you offered us if we surrendered was a quick and painless death.\""

Isn't that what they said they'd give us if we surrendered?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right. I would have probably done the same. I guess we're done here, then. Let's go back to our cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be honest,\" says Kate, as we make our way back to camp. \"I didn't really expect you to pull it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Neither did I.\"\r\n\r\n\"I owe you one, Barry. I won't forget this debt.\"\r\n\r\nWe spent the rest of our trip back in silence. But I didn't really find it awkward anymore.
