The fact that he's walking with his eyes closed and his hands in his pockets is not really helping his case either. He looks like he just got out of bed to get a midnight snack, and definitely not like a participant in a life and death tournament.

But tell me, hero, what happens when your pure ideals clash with the cold hard truth of reality?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Daren falls flat on his chest, and I can tell he's being pressed against the ground by a very powerful force. \r\n\r\n\"What happens when you meet a force so great that it simply squashes you against the ground, as if you were an insect?\"\r\n\r\nThe force pushing Daren against the ground intensified so much that it made a large Daren shaped hole in the hard rock soil beneath him. He could no longer hold back the pain and started screaming in agony."

If you let us live, we could deliver a message for you, in case we find these friends of yours before you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're saying your friend's life is only worth delivering a message?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is to you. I think you've already made it abundantly clear that human life holds no value to you. That means it should be all the same to you if you let us live or not. But if you let us live, you will get your message delivered. How's that for an even trade?\"\r\n\r\nEiden laughs, and the force pushing Daren against the ground gets weaker.\r\n\r\n\"When you put it like that, I suppose you have a point. Very well, then. Your lives for a message.\"\r\n\r\nHe stops for a bit to think, before he continues.\r\n\r\n\"The friends I'm looking for always wear dark blue robes, and on their chests they should have brooches that picture a hawk holding the sun in its talons.

I'll stop you, no matter the cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"See, now that puts me in a difficult position, since I already made an even trade with Barry over there.

Eiden dodges effortlessly, and Daren quickly goes for a second strike, this time meant to cut him in half. Eiden steps casually to the side, making it look like child's play. After a few more wasted strikes on Daren's part, just when it looked as though he might have caught the stillwater on the wrong foot, Eiden simply put his bare hand in front of his face, and stopped the full blow of the sword with only his index finger.\r\n\r\n\"No...\" Daren says, as if he couldn't believe his eyes."

I'm pretty sure that Daren has some really strong spells protecting him at all times. Standard sleep spells should be no more than a moderate inconvenience for him.\r\n\r\nWhile I try to wake Daren up, I suddenly hear a very familiar voice coming from the direction in which Eiden disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Stillwater!\"\r\n\r\nThat's Cutthroat Dave's voice. No doubt about it. I'd recognize that hoarse voice and that thuggish accent anywhere. \r\n\r\nI turn around towards where the voice came from, but there's only trees. Why would Cutthroat Dave shout for me before even getting the chance to get a clear shot of my face?\r\n\r\nThen it hit me. He never got to see my face. I was hiding behind a tree the whole time. I rush towards the woods to confirm my suspicions. I hide behind one of the trees and take a peek. \r\n\r\nJust as I thought, Cutthroat Dave has mistaken Eiden for me, and he's looking for revenge. He's managed to assemble a team in the short time we were apart, and they all have the stillwater surrounded. The sad part is that Dave looks like a well-bred gentleman compared to his new colleagues. Some of them look and smell like they haven't washed for months. I guess birds of a feather really do flock together."

I am sure of that too. You'd have needed to open your eyes in order to see me.\"\r\n\r\nAll of Cutthroat Dave's men suddenly burst into laughter at the same time. They're laughing loudly and vulgarly, probably in an attempt to intimidate their victim, just like a group of school bullies. Eiden's expression does not change, and he continues to smile pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't think you can fool me by changing your voice a little. I'm too smart for that. I'd recognize that arrogant tone of yours anywhere. Where's your healer friend? Did he leave you here to rot after you saved his skin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you perhaps speaking of the healer in armor? If that's the case, then he's right there, past these trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! Nice try, stillwater.

I very much doubt that anyone's going to mourn their passing.\r\n\r\nI decide to not intervene, and let the battle run its course.\r\n\r\nCutthroat Dave initiates by sending a few flying knives towards the stillwater. Just as they reach Eiden, they all stop in mid air in front of him. Eiden smirks and he points towards the cutthroat. All of the knives unconditionally obey their new master, and head towards Dave at breathtaking speed. He manages to parry them in the nick of time with his own flying knives, but he looks dumbstruck.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of sorcery is this?\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"The magic kind, of course,\" the stillwater answers him. \"See, this is a tournament for mages. Circus auditions were being held across the street.\"\r\n\r\nDave's face contorts into a snarl.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see how funny you are with some holes in your skull, you cheeky bastard. Men, teach this little upstart a lesson.\"\r\n\r\nAll of Cutthroat Dave's men jump at Eiden, but he disappears right from under their nose and appears in front of Dave with a grin on his face, though his eyes remain shut."

Cutthroat Dave's life had ended just like that, without even having the time to realize he was dead. \r\n\r\nBlinded by rage, Dave's loyal followers rushed screaming towards Eiden, with their weapons at the ready. They didn't get too far, though. With a snap of his fingers, the stillwater made a huge pillar of fire appear in front of him, which incinerated all of the thugs to a point where not even their bones were left intact. The fire completely ignored all of the trees around it, and Eiden simply put it out with another snap of his fingers.\r\n\r\nI expected this to be quick. But this outcome far exceeded my expectations. He can even cast fire magic. Just what in the hell are we supposed to do to fight this guy?\r\n\r\nEiden turns towards me. I suddenly remember that he relies primarily on his magical sense and not on his eyesight in order to assess his surroundings. He must have sensed my presence ever since before the beginning of the battle."

It feels like an invisible rope is tied around my neck, and it is slowly lifting me above the ground. It's not just my imagination. I really am being lifted higher and higher above the ground. It's getting a lot harder to breathe as the invisible noose gets tighter around my neck. I try to take the noose off with my hands, but there's nothing there. If this goes on much longer I'm seriously going to die.\r\n\r\nOnce I get several feet above the ground, the invisible noose suddenly disappears, and I fall on the rocky soil, dropping to my knees.

He seizes the opportunity and quickly pulls out a teleportation scroll out of his pocket. Before anyone of us has the time to react, he casts the spell, and pops out without a trace.\r\n\r\nWhere in the hell did that lowlife get a teleportation scroll from? I've been searching one for months and came up empty. Not to mention that even a single one of those scrolls costs a fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Now look at what happened!\" Kate says, furious. \"He got away. Was that the gods' decision too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not mock the gods, woman,\" Daren replies. \"No one could have known a common thug like him would have had access to a teleportation scroll.\""

No doubt about it. I'd recognize that hoarse voice and that thuggish accent anywhere. \r\n\r\nI turn around towards where the voice came from and see that aside from a familiar face, there are also about a dozen other unfamiliar faces lined up in front of me.\r\n\r\nIt would appear Dave has managed to assemble a team in the short time we were apart. The sad part is that Dave looks like a well-bred gentleman compared to his new colleagues. Some of them look and smell like they haven't washed for months. I guess birds of a feather really do flock together.\r\n\r\n\"I've been looking for you, stillwater,\" Dave says. \"I've been tracking your footsteps since yesterday. I told you we'd meet again.

Dave readies two daggers he was holding in his hands, and prepares to block my strike. \r\n\r\nInstead of slashing at him, I feint an attack, and quickly side step to his right side. As I was hoping, he did not see the flying daggers that were following close behind me, and as a result, he did not get to stop them in time. Two of them went right through his stomach and another one through his left leg.\r\n\r\nOne more hit should finish this once and for all."

Where would the fun in that be? But do not fret! As long as you remain on this island, you will get your answers sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiles.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then. I'll be waiting for you to deliver my message. Do not fail me, Barry.\"\r\n\r\nWith these last words he turns his back to me, and he disappears into the darkness of the forest."
